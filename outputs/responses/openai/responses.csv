The comic shows two characters discussing how to remember a room code, ""020518."" One character suggests memorizing it as ""the first three prime numbers, if you realized you couldn't remember what came after 2 and started to panic and get them increasingly wrong."" This is humorous because the numbers 0, 2, 0, 5, 1, and 8 are not prime numbers, and the suggestion is an absurd way to remember the code. The other character is frustrated because this method actually works for them, highlighting the unpredictability of memory. The mouseover text adds another layer of humor by suggesting the code could also be a mnemonic for remembering birthdays, specifically if relatives were born on February 5th, 2018.

The comic humorously contrasts serious scientific challenges with the trivial question of what the ""p"" in ""pH"" stands for, treating it as a major unsolved problem. The joke lies in the fact that the meaning of ""p"" in ""pH"" is well-known, making its inclusion as a ""top unsolved problem"" absurd. The mouseover text adds humor by jokingly denying the existence of loose protons as real hydrogen, suggesting ""p"" stands for ""pretend,"" playing on the idea of scientific denialism.","The comic shows a group of people at a ""Grand Opening"" event, with one person at a podium announcing the focus of their lab on unsolved chemistry problems.

The title and mouseover text play on the idea that a simple mistake with ravioli could lead to a hazard as severe as mishandling a lithium battery, which is depicted as dangerous in the comic. The humor lies in the absurdity and exaggeration of these scenarios.","The comic is a 4x4 grid with different objects in the rows: ravioli, throw pillow, Capri Sun, and bulging lithium battery. The columns represent actions: ""Eat with a fork,"" ""Rest your head on,"" ""Puncture and slurp,"" and ""Install in your phone."" Each cell humorously depicts the result of combining the object with the action.

The title ""Ravioli-Shaped Objects"" suggests that these items are similar in shape but have very different uses and consequences. The mouseover text refers to the NFPA hazard diamond, which indicates health, flammability, instability, and special hazards. The joke is that a failed ravioli recipe could somehow be as hazardous as a bulging lithium battery.

The comic uses humor by showing absurd or dangerous outcomes when the objects are used incorrectly, like eating a throw pillow or slurping a battery. The bulging lithium battery is particularly dangerous, as shown by the skulls and explosions.","The comic humorously explores the consequences of using ravioli-shaped objects in inappropriate ways.

The comic shows a person standing under an aurora, which is a natural light display in the Earth's sky, predominantly seen in high-latitude regions. The aurora is caused by the collision of solar wind and magnetospheric charged particles with the high altitude atmosphere. The sign in the comic reads, ""Welcome Solar Protons! You'll love being part of our atmosphere! There's so much to do here. Try forming water!"" This suggests a humorous take on solar protons interacting with Earth's atmosphere. The mouseover text, ""If any of you want to meet some cool local oxygen atoms, I can introduce you!"" adds to the humor by personifying the protons and oxygen atoms as if they are socializing.

The comic is a table listing various temperature scales, each with its water freezing and boiling points, notes, and a ""cursedness"" rating. The scales include familiar ones like Celsius, Kelvin, and Fahrenheit, as well as less common ones like Réaumur, Rømer, and Rankine. Some scales have humorous or historical notes, such as ""Real Celsius,"" which originally had larger numbers for colder temperatures. The ""Dalton"" scale is particularly absurd, with a nonlinear scale where 0°C and 100°C are both 0 and 100 Dalton, but 50°C is 53.9 Dalton. The mouseover text suggests a new scale, °X, with 0 as Earth's record lowest temperature, 50 as the global average, and 100 as the record highest, adjusted annually.

The humor comes from the absurdity and impracticality of some scales, especially the ""Dalton"" scale, and the idea of constantly adjusting a scale like °X. The ""cursedness"" rating adds to the humor by quantifying how impractical or strange each scale is.

The comic features two characters discussing Númenor, a fictional place from J.R.R. Tolkien's Middle-earth legendarium. One character mistakenly associates Númenor with ""Margaritaville,"" a song by Jimmy Buffett, known for its tropical, laid-back themes. The other character, likely an elf, is frustrated by this comparison. The elf references Ar-Pharazôn, a character from Tolkien's works, and Tol Eressëa, another fictional location. The humor arises from the juxtaposition of Tolkien's epic fantasy with the relaxed, beachy vibe of Jimmy Buffett's music. The mouseover text further blends Tolkien's imagery with a reference to ""Tequila Sunrise,"" another song, enhancing the comedic effect.
