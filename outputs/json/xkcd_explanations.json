[{"URL":"https:\/\/www.explainxkcd.com\/wiki\/index.php\/2927","Publish date":"May 1, 2024","Explanation":"This comic shows a map of the United States, with every state resized based on where it appears in an alphabetical list of states. Hence Alabama is the largest state and Wyoming is the smallest. The joke is that the comic purports to\"be more fair\". But there's nothing fair or unfair about sizing states by alphabetical order, whether or not it is'fair' in the first place to have states being shown as bigger or smaller merely because of raw geographical fact (and perhaps a little bit of cartographic bias).\n\nWyoming shrank the most proportionally in geographical size, while Delaware grew the most. Compared to a ranking of US states by area, Texas dropped the most (41 places), while Delaware and Connecticut rose the most (also 41 places). South Carolina and Vermont did not change rank.\n\nThis coincides with a recent study from the University of Michigan showing that the alphabetical order of surnames leads to differences in grading.\n\nWith 2024 being an election year in the United States, this comic may be a spoof on electoral cartograms, which resize the states based on their number of electoral votes (roughly the same as resizing them based on population).\n\nThe title text creates a portmanteau of the words “wee,” which means “little,” and “Wyoming,” making fun of how small it is on this map, since Wyoming appears last on the alphabetical list of states, it could also refer to the previous comic, which discussed siren noises. It may also refer to the common mispronunciation of the name, or a deliberate renaming to push it higher alphabetically.\n\nBias resulting from alphabetical order was also the topic of 2789: Making Plans.\n\nIt should be noted that the resizing is not done perfectly in the drawing. For example, Vermont appears slightly larger than Texas, and Idaho appears smaller than Missouri. The map strikes a balance between actually making the sizes of the states correspond to their alphabetical order, keeping the shapes of the states correct, and making the\"lower 48\" states fit together contiguously. The shapes of many states are significantly warped, such as Maryland, Delaware, and New York (which is lacking Long Island).\n\nThe table below ranks the states according to their actual size, their alphabetical order, and their approximate size as they are drawn in the comic.\n\n<table class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: right;\">\n<tr>\n<th rowspan=\"3\"> State\n<\/th>\n<th

2024","Explanation":"Quality Assurance (QA) engineers are responsible for ensuring the quality of some product through the use of testing. In software, this process often involves entering bizarre and\/or nonsense inputs in an attempt to break the software. Cueball, a QA engineer in this case, expresses concern that the scheduling system might crash. This could either be because as a QA engineer he is concerned about crashes in general, or that as a system used by QA engineers it likely has a lot of weird\/invalid values that could cause a crash.\n\nFor example, here it seems that Software Testing Day, a day likely celebrated by QA engineers, takes place every −1 years on January 0th at 25:71 PM. That statement is nonsensical in the following ways:\n\n<ul><li> The frequency of a recurring event is always expressed as a positive amount of time, so a negative value like “every −1 years” does not make sense. Negative values are an often-overlooked edge case in software, as they are valid numeric values that the computer will happily accept and work with unless specifically told not to. Depending on what the software is designed to do, this could result in unexpected behavior that could produce nonsensical results or crash the system. Under some circumstances, one piece of code can interpret a value as a small negative number, while another piece of code interprets <i>the same value<\/i> as a very large positive number. A variable that one section interprets as −1 <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Two%27s_complement\" title=\"wikipedia:Two's complement\">might be interpreted elsewhere<\/a> as 255, 65535, 4294967295, or even more, unless the software is either very strongly-typed (so as to actively prevent <i>any<\/i> casual attempt to change the understood context and value of data) or consistently weakly-typed throughout (the user does not normally define the type, automatic data-typing internalises the understanding (and any conversion) for anything the user does not deliberately make abstract for their own purposes).<\/li>\n<li> The first day of the month is the 1st, not the 0th.  (There is an entire <i>category<\/i> of bugs\/errors which result from numbering systems being mistaken for <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Zero-based_numbering\" title=\"wikipedia:Zero-based numbering\">starting with 0 instead of 1<\/a>, or vice versa.)<\/li>\n<li> There are (<a class=\"extiw\" href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Daylight_saving_time\" title=\"wikipedia:Daylight saving time\">in most cases<\/a>) only 24 hours in a day, so “25” is (in most cases) too large, and even where there is a switch from Daylight Saving Time, clocks simply repeat the hour before midnight, so the numbers above 24 hours are not displayed, even if using the 24-hour notation.\n<ul><li> In addition, the “PM” suggests that it is a 12-hour time, so the expected range of values for the hour is 1 to 12, making the “25” even more nonsensical.<\/li><\/ul><\/li>\n<li> There are only 60 minutes in an hour, so “71” is too large for a normally anticipated minute value.<\/li><\/ul>\n\nApparently, though this date is nonsensical, the QA engineers have decided to make this date a celebration day. Probably since, as expressed in the comic, the software for keeping track of the date has crashed. Another interpretation of this comic could be how software always crashes in one form or another when being tested, and thus the nonsensical date implies that successful runs of software is never celebrated.\n\nAll numerical values are out of range, suggesting that a QA engineer picked this date to test the scheduling system. If the date were to be made sense through under\/overflow, it would result on January 1st at 14:11 (2:11 PM). And the -1 year interval could be interpreted to mean it happens every year (perhaps with the annual events being numbered backwards). Alternatively, an attempt to enter these numbers might be rejected as invalid, forcing the user to enter a properly formatted date and time. Both\"January\" and\"PM\" are acceptable values; because these two items tend to be selected from predetermined lists since they have an extremely limited number of possible values, it's rarely possible to enter an invalid value for either of these fields.\n\nThe title text suggests that the recordkeeping system used to see how often employees celebrated Software Testing Day kept crashing, possibly due to the employees purposefully inputting nonsensical dates or a date that occurred prior to the previous celebration. QA engineers may have semi-accidentally crashed the system by testing it, or deliberately crashed it to disguise the frequency of their days off.\n\nIn real life, such invalid dates would be rejected or coerced to be valid dates. Failing to account for invalid dates may result in errors, sometimes catastrophic, such as the February 29, 2012 Microsoft Azure outage caused by the server trying to generate a certificate valid until February 29, 2013, a date that does not exist as 2013 being a non-leap year.\n\nTreatment of invalid dates varies by the chosen programming language and date-time library. Javascript, for example, would coerce January 0th into December 31st, and 25 o’clock into 1 o’clock the following day. While there is no way to directly create a Javascript Date object using 12-hour notation (because that requires text parsing, and the validation of the text input would just result in an invalid date), the following code snippet represents how far this correction can be taken advantage of:\n\nAn event happening every −1 years is equivalent to one that happens every year, but the numbers are reversed; i.e. if this year hosts the 1st Software Testing Day, next year will host the 0th Software Testing Day. This is expected to cause issues in software that assumes that the 2nd Software Testing Day will occur after the 1st Software Testing Day, an assumption that time only moves in one direction that may or may not be reasonable.\n\nThe holiday may be due to the claim of\"we really can't do anything else, during this automated process\", using the same sort of logic as 303: Compiling justified for the programming team. Albeit that here we explicitly learn that a failure behind the scenes will cancel the'sanctioned' pausing\/idling-away of contracted work hours, much as a notable compilation\/build error would interupt the others' few minutes of office sports.\n\n<ul><li> Seconds usually go from 0 to 59. However, when a leap second is added, December 31st, 23:59:59 UTC is followed by 23:59:60 (11:59:60 PM) before starting the new year.<\/li>\n<li> \"24:00\" can be used to unambiguously state the <i>closing<\/i> midnight of a given date. i.e. the same as \"00:00\" upon the next, but without the ambiguity as to which 'midnight' bookending of the given date it might refer to, e.g. for deadlines.\n<ul><li> It can be generally used to simplify the understanding of how much time is encompassed by a period starting at a pre-midnight time and ending at a post-midnight one.<\/li><\/ul><\/li>\n<li> Japan, in particular, <a class=\"external text\" href=\"https:\/\/media-cdn.tripadvisor.com\/media\/photo-s\/16\/7b\/00\/cd\/proof-that-there-are.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">uses<\/a> <a class=\"external text\" href=\"https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/qulk93jj2w731.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6b8a8abe10579156b853fff140f5f08dce7646f8\" rel=\"nofollow\">hour numbers<\/a> greater than 24 to express times past midnight but before sunrise. For example, 25:00 on a Friday is the same time as 1:00 the following Saturday. This is mainly used to express the starting times of midnight TV programming and the closing times of bars and other establishments open late at night. The hours usually go up to 27, but numbers up to 30 (6AM of the following day) are also sometimes seen. It allows the timepoint to 'belong' to the normal working day that precedes it, rather than setting it prior to the normally expected start of business for the day after (especially when that involved weekends).<\/li><\/ul>","comic_index":2928},{"URL":"https:\/\/www.explainxkcd.com\/wiki\/index.php\/2929","Publish date":"May 6, 2024","Explanation":"This is a scatter plot comparing how good an idea sounds to how good the idea is.

A solar cycle is the amount of time that elapses between times of maximum (or minimum) solar flare activity. This period is approximately 11 years.\n\nSolar flares can generate interest, and'news' stories at times of high activity, because they can sometimes cause aurorae, as well as power outages and other similar issues. Hence people will be more aware of them, and search for\"solar flares\" on Google to learn more about them. This trend somewhat matches the solar cycle since people will be more interested\/concerned about solar flares during the times they are abundant and search for them more often. Randall notes that Google has existed for long enough to see the trend in searches for\"solar flare\" over a full solar cycle.\n\nThe title text comments that people usually Google\"hangover cure\" 14 hours after they search for cocktail recipes. This suggests that people decide they want cocktails, look for ways to make cocktails, make (and presumably drink) the cocktails, wake up with a hangover and look for ways to get rid of the hangover. Google trends does indeed suggest that there is roughly a 14-hour difference in peaks between these searches. However this does not mean (as the title text implies) that the people searching for cocktail recipes are the same people that are searching for hangover cures later. It may represent the (not unreasonable) assumption that people who are exploring the idea of cocktails (for themselves or others) generally start to do so from the early evening onward, whilst those who find themselves freshly under the weather (not just from cocktail consumption) are likely to be finally provoked to look up a solution from around mid-morning.\n\nOne can illustrate the pitfalls of assuming such causation by substituting\"chicken nuggets\" for\"cocktail recipe\" which shows a very similar relationship. Chicken nuggets are not known to cause hangovers. [ citation needed]\n\nLooked at another way, there is a 10-hour'lag' from searching for\"hangover cure\" to searching for\"cocktail recipe\"; this does not imply that having a hangover is causing people to be interested in drinking cocktails! (Though they may lead to chicken nuggets.)\n\nAnother very important problem with looking at scales of less than a day is that the Earth has 38 time zones, and people drink cocktails and wake up all the time around the world. Since everyone is searching the same Google, it is impossible to deduce anything on a daily basis by looking at global data. It is possible to see only searches from a particular country, but even then, in the case of the US there are several hours difference from east to west that may smear out any such direct observations. This also applies to other countries\/regions, being potentially at its most extreme in Russia. This might be moot if the data is preprocessed to'local' time, although the opposite issue might arise in a case such as Chinese data (though any examination of Google Trends for China may not be fruitful).\n\nThe sunspot cycle was'explained' in 2725: Sunspot Cycle.","comic_index":2930},{"URL":"https:\/\/www.explainxkcd.com\/wiki\/index.php\/2931","Publish date":"May 10, 2024","Explanation":"This comic is a scatter plot comparing how exciting it is to see various things with how possible it is to chase them using a convoy of coordinated vehicles.\n\nThe least chasable are stationary places like the Grand Canyon or International Date Line. It makes no sense to chase them because they don't move around, you simply go to their known locations. At the other end of the chasability spectrum are animals that move around rapidly, and fleeting astronomical and atmospherical phenomena like clouds, meteors and aurora. However, some of these are difficult to chase because they're small and hard to detect from a moving vehicle, e.g. gnats.\n\nIn the top-right position of most chasable and most exciting, tornadoes have a community of'chasers' who attempt to predict their appearance and get as close to them as possible, which was the subject of a 1996 film, for which a sequel was due to be released shortly after this comic. A major tornado outbreak had also taken place immediately preceding the comic's publication.\n\nThe title text suggests that combining some of these things into a single event would multiply the excitement derived from them. This makes sense on the surface, as the rarity value of the resulting event would be high, so even two relatively mundane events could, when combined, produce an interesting outcome. However, it somewhat undermines this by suggesting that, in this particular location, the event in question (possums being hit by passing tumbleweeds) is relatively routine.\n\n<table class=\"wikitable sortable\">\n<tr>\n<th rowspan=\"2\"> Entity <\/th>\n<th colspan=\"2\"> Estimate of... <\/th>\n<th rowspan=\"2\"> Explanation\n<\/th><\/tr>\n<tr>\n<th>                             Chasing <\/th>\n<th> Excitement\n<\/th><\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td> <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Grand_Canyon\" title=\"wikipedia:Grand Canyon\">The Grand Canyon<\/a><\/td>\n<td> 10% <\/td>\n<td> 90% <\/td>\n<td> Stationary place in Arizona.

Some drivers, when having priority by the rules of the road (termed\"right of way\" in US legal statutes), will let others take it before them. However, yielding the right of way when it is not required does not legally grant the other driver the right of way -- they may still be required to yield to other vehicles on the road. (Hence the title of the PSA:\"Random drivers can't grant you the right of way as a gift.\")\n\nAt a 4-way stop, giving another driver the right of way is usually safe and courteous, but in other cases it can be dangerous. This comic is saying that people who exhibit this behavior dangerously can be assumed to be Terminator -style assassins, sent to kill you by sending you into contention with other traffic to make it look like an accident, and thereby prevent some future act on your part that is not to their liking.\n\nIn this comic, the deferential driver is holding up a queue of vehicles (including a large tractor-trailer truck) that is obscuring the immediate view of oncoming traffic. Instead of simply turning left and reducing the queue, they are waving Randall's car into that traffic, perhaps because they forgot that the other lanes have priority over the crossing driver. The effect could be to wave him through right into the path of another car traveling at full speed — a clever way for a time-traveling assassin to take down one's target without arousing suspicion.\n\nNot pulling into traffic when your view is obstructed is good advice, and Randall's comical exaggeration may make the advice more memorable. Always check for yourself that your way is clear, and if your view is blocked, sit tight.\n\nHowever, Randall seems to be assuming that the waving gesture can only ever mean one thing: Pull all the way into traffic. It may be that a\"waving out\" gesture is intended to give the waiting car a chance to turn into the median strip (see details below). Viewing courteous behavior as conclusive evidence of a temporal assassination conspiracy is humorously ego-centric and improbable.\n\nThe title text explains that Randall made this PSA because he has experienced this multiple times in the last month, and that the assassins should try harder next time.\n\nNote that in this comic, as currently illustrated, there appears to be sufficient room in the median strip for the waiting car to pass the first set of lanes and stop in the median strip, protected from passing traffic on both sides, to legally wait for the second stream of traffic to safely subside. Waiting in this median turning area is a normal maneuver in suburban and exurban US areas where these types of non-signaled intersections are common. There's no reason to assume that the supposed would-be assassin is not simply waving the waiting car to the safety of the median strip. Randall's message of caution is still sound, but he accidentally illustrated an intersection diagram that fails to optimally support his case.\n\n\n\nLegality\n\nMedian strips are typically used to allow vehicles to safely make left turns without impeding the flow of traffic. When emerging from a side road, vehicles can cross the first lane(s) of traffic and wait in the median strip until it is safe to merge into the opposite lane(s).\n\n<ul><li> In Texas, using the median strip to wait for a gap in traffic is generally acceptable. The Texas Department of Public Safety suggests that drivers use the median strip when appropriate.

This reflects a common scientific pursuit, reductionism, to uncover the basic principles underlying all physical phenomena in order to understand them. For example, most chemical reactions can be explained as the recombinations of a few dozen common elements.\n\nThe comic then splits into two branches representing different fields of physics which refute Cueball's optimistic assumption: condensed matter physics and quantum field theory.\n\nOn the left, the concept of antireductionism (or holism) is demonstrated by the Condensed Matter Physics branch. Cueball encounters a cloud of vibrating particles, which symbolizes the complexity that arises when simple particles combine to produce complex behaviors. The issue with reducing down to particles is that the number of different interactions between particles to understand makes the topic no longer simple. This highlights the challenge of predicting macroscopic properties from microscopic interactions, a central theme in condensed matter physics. This is shown in everyday life, from things like a baseball curving through the air, to how a mirror reflects light. 1734: Reductionism also touches on the impracticality of gaining knowledge about a larger construct through understanding its constituent parts.\n\nOn the right, in the Quantum Field Theory branch, Cueball is faced with the issue that particles at the quantum level aren't simple. Quantum Field Theory deals with the fundamental particles and forces of nature, and it describes a complex world where particles can behave as both waves and particles simultaneously, among other strange phenomena.\n\nThe title text introduces a third branch: the field of cosmology, which deals with the large-scale structure and history of the universe. Cosmology suggests that even our catalog of the most fundamental particles might be inadequate - perhaps an allusion to theorized phenomena like dark matter and dark energy - raising questions about the nature of existence itself.\n\nNo matter how you study the universe, it's complicated.

Software engineers use Bloom filters to check if something is probably in a set or to estimate how many things are in that set, using limited memory.\n\n<ul><li> One example: the Chrome web browser used to store a Bloom filter of URLs that were known to be malicious<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-1\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">[1]<\/a><\/sup>, based on a database that was too large to store locally. Chrome used that Bloom filter to confirm that it didn’t need to warn the user that they were visiting a malicious page. Only in the rare cases that the Bloom filter said the URL might be malicious, Chrome would send the URL to an external service to confirm whether it was known to be malicious. The developers didn’t want the browser to send <i>every<\/i> URL to the external service because that would leak the user’s entire browsing history to the service and would add an unnecessary network delay whenever a web page was loaded.<\/li><\/ul>\n\nHere's how a Bloom filter works:\n\nIn the comic, Cueball is holding a piece of paper or tablet computer with a large\"1\" digit on it. This is labeled as a 1-bit Bloom filter, which is almost useless. When empty, it correctly returns a negative for any item tested, but as soon as one item is added the bit is set to 1, and now it unhelpfully says that any item tested might be in the set. Its size estimate also becomes\"between 1 and infinity,\" which isn’t helpful.\n\nHaving multiple hash functions is pointless for a 1-bit filter since they all end up pointing to the same single bit, which would return the exact same answer as a result.\n\nThe title text carries the characteristics of the Bloom filter into the decision-making process for choosing a Bloom filter over other candidate data structures. Analogously (according to the text), you can be sure when they are not the best approach but only conclude that they are with a limited degree of probability.","comic_index":2934},{"URL":"https:\/\/www.explainxkcd.com\/wiki\/index.php\/2935","Publish date":"May 20, 2024","Explanation":"Upon hearing the term\"ocean loop\", many people think of horizontal ocean gyres or ocean currents. This comic illustrates a vertical, rather than horizontal, ocean loop.\n\nThe comic shows a large construction, rising out of the sea to dwarf a nearby cruise ship. It involves a submerged water-jet sending water up out of the surface and round a rollercoaster-loop-like water-flume trough. The scale is such that it seems that the ship, once caught in the necessarily powerful stream of water, is also intended to be propelled around the inverting loop before\"safely\" exiting at the other side.\n\nThe design is reminiscent of the infamous'Cannonball Loop' water slide - a fully-functional water slide complete with a loop-de-loop - which was one of many famously dangerous rides and attractions at Action Park; a theme park in New Jersey that became iconic for its blithe disregard for human safety, and the numerous accidents and deaths at the park as a result. This video, among other potentially dangerous water slides, shows 2 such loop-de-loop water slides ( 1 and 2). Apart from various other issues regarding large\"loop-de-loops\", the stream of water required to maintain this setup would be acting upon the nearby water and so the nearby ship is probably already close enough to be drawn into the loop (with the best option left being to deliberately steer into it, rather than risk being swept uncontrollably into the structure), assuming that it isn't already caught in the tug of the water-jet's inward flow.\n\nEven assuming a\"successful\" loop (the stresses and rotation inflicted by the loop are likely beyond the design limits of such a vessel), the emergence back into the relatively calm and stationary waters beyond the exiting outflow would be a severe challenge to navigation. On the positive side, due to the nature of buoyancy, if the loop structure itself is capable of withstanding the force of the water being forced round it then it should be equally capable of withstanding the passage of the ship, unlike an impromptu rail-based loop which might stand up on its own but then shake itself apart when the first carriage is sent around it.\n\nNot only would there be problems for the engineers, ship and navigators, the\"ride\" wouldn't be pleasant for the ship's passengers in any way. Many of the passengers would suffer extreme injuries from the changes of velocity (up to 370km\/h or 230mph based on a loop radius of 3 x ship length) and rotation (unlike rollercoasters, or even airplanes during simple take-off and landing, passengers aren't normally strapped down). It is possible that the initial extreme undercurrent would capsize the ship. Depending upon where in the ship you were, the centripetal forces and the ship's rotation may not match for all passengers, forcing anyone not properly secured out towards the bow or stern. As well as the passengers, this also is relevant to all unsecured items (e.g. knives and forks would go flying off tables), as well as the dangers of breakable glass, liquids and many other dangerous objects which could create hazards even (or particularly) against those who have strapped themselves down to prevent their own movement through the ship.\n\nBecause of all these safety concerns, the caption,\" I don't know why the cruise line fired me\", suggests that someone in the company realized this would not be a good idea, and shut down the concept. However, the title text,\"I can't believe they wouldn't even let me hold a vote among the passengers about whether to try the loop\", implies that the narrator (whether because they simply hadn't thought it through properly, or they are someone with a sadistic nature) actually managed to get as far as building this loop and having a ship ready to try it. Considering the vast budget that would have been required to realise this concept, it appears that oversight at the cruise company is not what it could be, and perhaps others should be in line for firing as well (if it has not already bankrupted the company).\n\nWhen those in charge of the ship objected to sailing into this loop, the builder attempted to get around this by having the passengers vote on it. Presumably worried that opening the decision-making process to the passengers might favor the exciting risk over the well-founded reason of the staff, those in charge put a stop to that too. Cruise ships generally don't function as democracies, even outside of absurd situations such as the one depicted.","comic_index":2935},{"URL":"https:\/\/www.explainxkcd.com\/wiki\/index.php\/2936","Publish date":"May 22, 2024","Explanation":"In this strip Black Hat begins by demonstrating exponential growth, using a variation of the wheat and chessboard problem, a classic demonstration of this mathematical principle. Exponential growth involves an initial quantity being multiplied by any number greater than one again and again. It can cause small numbers to compound into very large numbers faster than might be intuitive. This principle is important in a number of real life applications, ranging from biological growth to inflation to reaction kinetics.\n\nThe earliest versions of this story come from India and involve a man (the inventor of chess, in some tellings), being offered a reward by a king, and asking that a single grain of wheat (rice, in some versions) be placed on the first square of a chessboard, two on the second, and each subsequent square having twice as many grains as the one before. In the story, the king generally laughs off such a reward as being trivial, but soon learns that the reward would be impossible to pay. Since a chessboard contains 64 squares, the final square would contain 2^63 (approximately 9.2 quintillion) grains. This would be around 600 billion tonnes of wheat (even in modern times, would be centuries of global wheat production).\n\nIn some versions of the story, the man is executed for embarrassing the king\/being over-greedy; in others, he's rewarded for his cleverness; in yet others he becomes king himself as a consequence. There are also other versions that subvert the well-known tale by the king not being so naïve as to fall for the'trick' played by the creator of the problem.\n\nBlack Hat initially appears to be using this example, to demonstrate a mathematical principle, but actually turns out to be using it to\"win\" a chess match by covering the chess board in rice until his opponent quits out of frustration. Naturally, despite his claims that it's\"nearly impossible to counter\", under the International Chess Federation (FIDE)'s Laws of Chess, this would be illegal on several levels, as deliberately distracting or annoying your opponent is a violation, as is deliberately displacing the chess pieces. Black Hat being Black Hat, he likely simply doesn't care, and counts it as a win when his opponent stomps off out of annoyance.\n\nGarry Kasparov and Antoly Karpov are both Russian chess grandmasters and former world champions. The two men famously competed for the world championship in the 1980s. The Kasparov gambit is an opening move in chess. The title text implies that Kasparov actually tried this method on Karpov, who attempted to consume all the rice with\"increasingly large rice cookers\", but eventually couldn't keep up. While this is obviously fictional, it fits with the principle of exponential growth. If exponential growth is unrestricted, it will eventually grow beyond the constraints of anything that could plausibly be built to contain it.\n\nIn any case, it appears that in his enthusiasm to enact his scheme, Black Hat has neglected to even set up his own pieces (or they have already been completely buried), never mind wait for the game to commence, so his opponent has nothing to resign from - indeed his king still appears to be standing as he walks away.","comic_index":2936},{"URL":"https:\/\/www.explainxkcd.com\/wiki\/index.php\/2937","Publish date":"May 24, 2024","Explanation":"Cueball and Megan are on vacation or otherwise traveling, and receive a code for their hotel room. Megan gives a seemingly nonsensical and unhelpful mnemonic by which Cueball can remember it... which, inexplicably, actually helps Cueball to remember the code. Cueball becomes VERY angry on realizing this.\n\nThe first three prime numbers are actually 2, 3, and 5. So this technique easily identifies the first two digits\"02\".\"05\" is slightly wrong because it's not the second prime number; it's the third. And\"18\" is even more wrong because it's not actually a prime number; it's 2 × 3 2.\n\nSo the mnemonic itself doesn't really provide the method for remembering the code. Instead, figuring out how to apply the bogus mnemonic will reinforce your memory of the code. Unless you actually happen to be really bad at prime numbers and panicked while remembering them, in which case the bad mnemonic actually... helps?! Why is your memory like this?!\n\nThe title text points out that the code is also similar to a date in the ( potentially ambiguous) MMDDYY format - not an unexpected choice, seeing as Randall lives in the United States - so if you happen to have a relative who was born on February 5th 2018, the memorized code will help you remember this date if using said date format. It is also a valid date in the DDMMYY format but in that case it would be the 2nd of May 2018, or in YYMMDD format, in which case it refers to 18th of May 2002.","comic_index":2937},{"URL":"https:\/\/www.explainxkcd.com\/wiki\/index.php\/2938","Publish date":"May 27, 2024","Explanation":"In less than 5 billion years into the future, the Andromeda Galaxy is expected to collide with the Milky Way. This comic suggests this will happen when both galaxies get into a kissing distance after having slurped the same cosmic spaghetti strand. This is a spoof of a famous scene in the movie Lady and the Tramp, where the titular dogs are eating spaghetti at an Italian restaurant. They happen to be eating the same strand from opposite ends, so they end up meeting in the middle and kissing. This scene was mentioned before in 2612: Lightsabers, and has been referenced extensively in other media.\n\nIt's possible that this is also a reference to Pastafarianism, the spoof religion which claims that the universe was created by a\"flying spaghetti monster\". If both galaxies are eating one of the deity's\"noodly appendages,\" they may be doing what the monster wishes, since one of the religion's holidays is about eating lots of pasta.\n\nThe title text figure of 200 septillion (2×10 26) calories for the Milky Way-Andromeda noodle equates to approximately 2500 calories per foot of noodle. This value makes sense only if Randall is referring to the physics\/chemistry\"small\" calorie (= 4.184 joules) rather than the dietary\"large\" Calorie (= 4184 joules). Dietary Calories, also called kilocalories (kcal), would be the usual meaning in a food-related context like this one, but Randall was trained as a physicist and apparently used the small calorie here. Having 2.5 dietary Calories per foot is roughly correct for a noodle size between thin spaghetti and angel hair. A noodle with similar ingredients and 2,500 dietary calories per foot would be roughly 26 centimeters in diameter, and might more properly be considered a type of pastry.\n\nThe nutritional value of dark matter refers to the fact that evidence of'dark matter' is particularly found in cosmic filaments and the cosmic web, implying that such\"cosmic spaghetti\" would have an appreciable amount of dark matter\"sauce\" on it. But, because the exact nature of dark matter is unknown, it is likely even more difficult to identify the calorific content that it might provide. Note that these filaments are much larger structures than the Local Group of galaxies that includes the Milky Way and Andromeda.","comic_index":2938},{"URL":"https:\/\/www.explainxkcd.com\/wiki\/index.php\/2939","Publish date":"May 29, 2024","Explanation":"Cueball is teaching about an algorithm's complexity. The average-case complexity of the algorithm is written in Big O notation as O( n log n), expressing the asymptotic runtime of the algorithm as the number of inputs to it grows larger and larger.\n\nThe comic's joke involves taking the terms\"best case\" and\"worst case\" far more broadly and literally than intended. Cueball presents not just the best\/worst cases for the data input into the function, but also the global environment as a whole, taking in factors such as the United States Congress which should fall far outside the algorithm's scope.\n\nIn particular, the joke regards the analysis of a closed system, which is common in engineering. An algorithm's\"best case\" is typically its runtime when its inputs have optimal values and it runs in as little time as possible. One example would be a sorting algorithm that is called with an already-sorted list of numbers; an algorithm may only need to check each item in the list, in one pass, to confirm this, compared with having to compare an arbitrary number of items against an arbitrary number of others across a number of cycles. The worst case would be when a list is'unsorted' in a way that presents the maximum number of challenges and actions to the sorting algorithm (possibly, but not necessarily, when presented with the initial list exactly in the wrong order\/reversed). These two limits can each be given by an O-notation, but a single O-notation generally indicates the mean complexity of operation encountered for all inputs.\n\nThe joke here is that not only does this algorithm'run' quicker than what would otherwise be considered its best case scenario, by being terminated early because it is deemed to be'unnecessary', but its runtime appears to be an hour shorter still because of an act of Congress changing daylight saving time, giving it an end time (in local time) that is an hour less than it would have been under other circumstances. Potentially this would result in an end time that is recorded as earlier than its start time (depending on how the times are handled), and therefore an apparently negative'runtime'. Daylight saving time is a recurrent theme on xkcd, and it is clear that Randall is not a fan, so Congress making surprise DST changes is another way for Randall to mock the concept.\n\nThe\"worst case\" refers to the movie Groundhog Day, in which the same events occur over and over in a sort of time loop. (This movie has been referenced before in 1076: Groundhog Day.) If the hardware running the algorithm is present in this kind of loop then it may also reset to a previous time before it gets finished, meaning the algorithm would never terminate. This gives rise to a philosophical question about the movie as to whether the whole world is reset after every day, or just the town where the movie takes place. If it is just the town, and you could still connect to their hardware from outside, then from that perspective the algorithm would appear to be taking an interminably long time to run. If the whole world resets, since people (aside from the movie's main character) do not experience the reset, it would only appear to take as long as it does once the last (non-resetting cycle) leads it into the expected following day.\n\nThis may be an indirect reference to the halting problem, a famous problem in computer science. The halting problem is undecidable, meaning that no general algorithm can tell whether a given algorithm will halt, but the widely accepted traditional proof of this relies on external action on details of a system considered closed.\n\nThe title text refers to perhaps an even more famous problem in computer science: P versus NP. This asks whether every problem whose solution can be quickly verified (in nondeterministic polynomial time, NP) can also be quickly solved (in polynomial time, P). The P-versus-NP problem is one of the seven Millennium Prize Problems, and as such has a $1 million prize for its solution. Presumably, the problem discussed here is in NP, so if P=NP, its worst-case runtime would be some polynomial O( n k). However, P vs. NP is a Millennium Prize Problem for a reason; most computer scientists expect that P≠NP, so hoping for a breakthrough in proving P=NP is\"perpetually optimistic\". This may be a reference to optimism bias and the planning fallacy, whereby people tend to assume that the most favourable outcome will be the most likely.","comic_index":2939},{"URL":"https:\/\/www.explainxkcd.com\/wiki\/index.php\/2940","Publish date":"May 31, 2024","Explanation":"Randall's chart compares different modes of transportation by how convenient and dangerous they are.

In the top-right, motorcycles are at the same convenience level, but are rated much more dangerous, since they are easy to lose control of at high speeds, and careless drivers (of cars) can easily hit a motorcycle and cause extreme harm. Things like unicycles (bottom-left) are considered much lower on the convenience scale, being not very fast or easy ways to travel, but relatively safe, while towards the centre, skis are apparently moderately convenient and moderately dangerous, since they are relatively easy to fall on if going fast downhill. Way out on their own in the bottom-right, hot air balloons appear to be unique in being rated least on convenience and highest on danger. Presumably, modes of transportation similar to hot air balloons (like zeppelins and blimps) are left off the chart to increase the gap for comedic effect.\n\nThe modes are grouped into several zones by darkened backgrounds -- the easiest or most effective that are also the safest ones (trains, cars, walking, biking, boats, etc.) are in the Zone of Practicality at the upper left. The ones that are mixed, ranging from very useful for travel but dangerous (motorcycles and helicopters) in the upper-right, through moderately dangerous and moderately unpractical (go karts, skateboards, rollerblades, skis, light aircraft) in the middle, to quite safe but totally unpractical for travel (bumper cars, unicycles, sleds) in the lower-left are in the Zone of Specialty or Recreational Vehicles. At the extreme of dangerous and very unpractical (lower-right) is a zone labeled simply????? containing only one mode: Hot Air Balloons.\n\nBecause a hot air balloon is rated so poorly, if an optimization algorithm considers it the optimal mode of transportation, it must be the result of a sign error (e.g. having a minus sign where a plus sign is supposed to be, or vice versa), making the algorithm optimize for the opposite result by mistake. This could be because, unusually, on the y axis of the chart higher is better, whereas on the x axis lower is better. If these were treated the wrong way around, it would result in the air balloon appearing to be the best result. More typically, you might plot convenience vs safety, so that a higher value on either axis would represent a better result. However, both measures are still likely to need to take underlying data (for safety, incident counts, etc.; for convenience, travel time, etc.) and invert them, leading to potential for errors.\n\nIn order to compare the relative danger from each mode of transport, one can look at statistics of fatalities and injuries sustained during each activity. Traditionally this can be reported in fatalities\/ KSI per mile driven or passenger mile (or other unit of distance), to account for the fact that some modes are used much more than others and make valid comparisons. They may also be reported per capita (but this ignores the relative usage of different modes), or per journey (but this doesn't take into account the fact that different modes typically have different journey lengths and times). All of these are somewhat flawed, since they are really measuring the danger to users of that mode of transport, both from their own conveyance, and from other sources such as other road users. Since ballooning is not a very common mode of transport, hot air balloon incidents are correspondingly uncommon, and flights are not routinely monitored or registered, it is difficult to draw strong conclusions from the data for hot air balloons.\n\nThe title text makes a joke that if a hot air balloon enthusiast disagrees with the ranking and is angered by it, they may wish to remonstrate or retaliate, but will have a difficult time getting to Randall's house with their preferred mode of transportation, because they are limited to travelling in the direction of the wind. If they chose an alternative form of transport, they would be making his point for him. In reality, hot air balloons have some freedom to choose their direction of travel, since by controlling their altitude they can access different wind directions at different heights. Randall should, therefore, be concerned about hot air balloonists who live within a wedge spanned by the various wind directions accessible on a given day. In principle, if the weather conditions are favorable, this could cover every direction from Randall's house. The phrase\"hot air balloon people\" is reminiscent of\"autogyro people\" from the title text of 1972: Autogyros.\n\nCuriously, the comic includes most common forms of transport, and a number of less common ones, but omits examples such as buses (a mass transit solution arguably more convenient than trains). It is not clear if this is an error, or a deliberate choice to maintain the comic's layout and presentation. Another omitted mode of transportation is horseback riding, which would possibly win over hot air balloons in sign-error optimization because in spite of horseback riding's increased convenience relative to hot air balloons, it is also more dangerous, especially if counting horse deaths. However, unlike hot air balloons, horseback riders could get to Randall's house even if the wind is not blowing in the exact right direction, and once they are at Randall's house, they could potentially have their horse kick down Randall's front door or even kick Randall, the latter of which could be fatal, so perhaps Randall intentionally omitted horses from the diagram for his personal safety.\n\nThis is the second comic in a row to feature an algorithm.\n\n<table class=\"wikitable sortable\">\n<tr>\n<th> Transportation <\/th>\n<th> Description <\/th>\n<th> Convenience <\/th>\n<th> Danger <\/th>\n<th> Zone\n<\/th><\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a class=\"extiw\" href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Train\" title=\"wikipedia:Train\">Trains<\/a>\n<\/td>\n<td>Mass transit on rails, typically between urban centers.\n<\/td>\n<td data-sort-value=\"89%\"><i>89±2%<\/i>: Convenient and comfortable, provided proper funding\/maintenance and filled timetables.

He then presents four side-view diagrams of the human mouth and paths depicting how it might conceptually move (it depending a lot on how the individual normally forms even the major phonemes) when saying increasingly fluid versions of\"going to.\"\n\nThe first diagram gives the pronunciation \/ɡoʊɪŋ tu\/ GO-ing TO. This is the version found in dictionaries and used when one is speaking slowly and deliberately. Here, the tongue and lips have to move a lot. The phrase starts at the back of the throat with a velar \/g\/ and moves into the diphthong OH \/oʊ\/ and the approximant \/w\/ to the KIT vowel \/ɪ\/. (Though it's not in the traditional IPA transcription or the comic, most native accents will insert a [w] between [ʊ] and another vowel.) The tongue then has to move right back to where it started for the\"ng\" in\"going\", the velar \/ŋ\/, followed by an even bigger jump forwards to the alveolar \/t\/ and back again for the back vowel \/u\/. Since \/t\/ is a voiceless consonant, the vocal cords will briefly stop vibrating, interrupting the sound, which the diagram illustrates as a gap in the path.\n\nThe second diagram shows a slightly more efficient pronunciation, in which the \/ŋ\/ is replaced by an \/n\/ instead since both \/n\/ and \/t\/ are alveolar sounds. The final \/u\/ weakens to the more neutrally positioned \/ə\/, which is the\"default\" vowel (aka you should be making this sound if you relax your mouth completely and give a small grunt). (For more about Schwa, see 2907: Schwa.) All doubling back of the tongue is now removed, leaving only a small, nearly closed loop.\n\nThe third diagram shows an even more efficient and very common pronunciation of the phrase, \/ɡʌnə\/ GUN-na. Here rather than optimizing tongue movement hard-to-pronounce sounds are removed or further replaced instead. The \/t\/ is dropped leaving only \/n\/, while the vowel(s) of the first syllable go from \/o\/ to \/ʌ\/ between which the only difference is the optional rounding, or pursing, of the lips - though more likely given Randall Munroe's prior comics demonstrating a ꜱᴛʀᴜᴛ-coᴍᴍᴀ merger, a supposed \/ə\/.\n\nThe fourth diagram shows the most reduced pronunciation. The \/n\/ is lost as a consonant in its own right, with only remnants of its existence found by the nasalisation of the preceding vowel where part of the airflow is redirected through the nose. (This is, incidentally, the same way that French got its famous nasal sounds - sequences of what used to be vowel + \/n\/ from Latin were reduced.) This way, the only motions one must make is to articulate the \/ɡ\/, which some would voice by an movement of the rear tongue although parts of the larynx may primarily be employed by others. This pronunciation seems almost unconnected to the original phrase of\"going to\". However, English speakers will still almost always understand this in context, and likely think they heard\"gonna\"\n\nIn some ways, this may also help explain how Neil Armstrong's line\"One small step for a man\" was heard over the radio as\"One small step for man\". As you move towards More Fluid, the phrase\"for a man\" can quickly become\"foreh-man\" and then\"fur-man\". While extensive research has been done elsewhere on this topic, when given the choice between a technical problem with the radio, and issues with phonetic pronunciation under pressure, the latter seems more likely.\n\nIn the bottom text, Randall comments on the perception of reduced pronunciations, remarking that while many perceive them as being sloppy, in reality deliberately pronouncing each word with the\"supposed\" pronunciation in its dictionary form sounds stilted, forced, and unnatural. The final T in the word\"hot\" is an example of this. Most people when thinking of T think there is only one way to pronounce it - usually the aspirated unvoiced alveolar plosive\"tuh\" found at the start of syllables - but in reality it varies widely depending on position and accent, most noticeable if one pronounces a word such as\"teat\". In this context the\"t\" in\"hot\" is replaced by a glottal stop; funnily enough, and perhaps ironically, despite being the same sound it is never stigmatized, unlike intervocalic\"t\"s such as bottle which some speakers, particularly some British ones, also replace with glottal stops (rendered'humorously' as bo'oh). It you speak English in the British\"standard\" Received Pronunciation form you may have to put on a fake American accent to understand this joke. It works best if you attempt an outrageous stereotype of a slurred non-English speaker.\n\nThe title text is a serious shout-out to linguist Gretchen McCulloch who has been teaching Randall about this stuff, but includes a joke about what happens when he tries these things out in public.","comic_index":2942},{"URL":"https:\/\/www.explainxkcd.com\/wiki\/index.php\/2943","Publish date":"June 7, 2024","Explanation":"Every field of research has unsolved problems considered\"important\" or\"significant\" that motivate continued research. The scientists at what is apparently the\"grand opening\" of their new chemistry lab list several real chemistry problems, followed by one also-unsolved-but-less-scientific problem (the p in pH)\n\nArbitrary Enzyme Design:\n\nEnzymes are catalytic proteins. Enzyme catalysis is often unique in comparison with other catalysis methods as it is highly specific, or tailored to a specific reaction. As such, enzyme catalysis, besides being the basis of all biochemical processes, is becoming increasingly relevant to industrial synthesis processes. As enzymes can easily be produced synthetically through recombinant gene technology, being able to design an arbitrary enzyme for any reaction would mean that effectively any reaction could be relatively easily catalyzed, revolutionizing the chemical synthesis industry.\n\nProtein Folding:\n\nProteins are large molecules that consist of chains of amino acids. These amino acid chains become folded in extremely complex ways to form intricate 3D structures, and the way a protein is folded is of critical importance to its function. Because of the huge importance of proteins to biological life, biologists have devoted significant attention over many decades to the problem of protein structure prediction. This refers to the ability to predict the 3D structure of a protein based on the amino acid sequence, and remains one of the most important problems in computational biology. The ability to predict protein structure purely from amino acid sequence — the so-called\"de novo\" prediction — is known in computational biology as an unusually difficult problem due to the complexity of amino acid chains. Known as\"Levinthal's paradox,\" the number of possible conformations from the backbone conformations alone is estimated to be in the ballpark of 10^300. Despite this, protein folding occurs extremely quickly in reality. Because of this difficulty in sampling conformations, even with optimization, such as secondary structure prediction and Monte Carlo simulation, a\"true\" accurate simulation is extremely computationally expensive. Because of this, the most accurate solutions, such as AlphaFold, utilize a combination of homology modeling (sampling experimentally determined proteins with similar sequences to infer structural motifs and similarities) and deep learning to accurately guess protein structure. See also 1430: Proteins.\n\nDepolymerization:\n\nPolymers are very large molecules formed out of repeating subunits called monomers. Monomers are molecules, typically organic in nature, that can bond with at least one other molecule, with two or more making long chains or networks called polymers. That process is known as polymerization. Depolymerization is breaking polymers down into the small molecules they were originally made from. This is done through a variety of processes, such as radiation, electrolysis, adding chemicals, and other means. Plastics are the best-known polymers, but cellulose, proteins, and DNA are also technically polymers. The huge number of varieties and mixtures in plastics makes recycling them a huge challenge, and there is increasing concern about plastic waste damaging the environment.\n\nPolymerization is usually exothermic, releasing energy as heat. To reverse this would require adding energy in a targeted way. Simply destroying a polymer — by means of highly-reactive chemicals, heat, or radiation — doesn't generally release the monomer molecules to a significant degree; most of the reaction products are highly degraded. Most polymers are made by a process of catalysis, with the small monomer molecules interacting via a catalyst structure, often in liquid form, and the eventual product is usually solid. To reverse this would require getting the catalyst to interact in a very precise way with the solid polymer, and it's relatively difficult for the catalyst structure to get into the proper configuration with the solid tangled polymer molecules.\n\nAnother highly-desired depolymerization process would be to convert cellulose into its component glucose molecules. That glucose could then be used for a variety of different purposes, including fermentation to alcohol to use as a fuel. Currently, when plants are grown, much of the solar energy and carbon dioxide they absorb ends up in the form of cellulose rather than as starch, sugar, protein, or other substances that we find useful. Our being able to make use of the cellulose would make farming much more energy-efficient. Some organisms are able to depolymerize cellulose by means of enzymes, but our ability to use similar processes on an industrial scale is still limited. (Those organisms use a complex multi-step biochemical process which essentially\"invests\" energy into splitting off a glucose molecule, then recoups the investment by metabolizing the glucose.) It's also possible to depolymerize cellulose at high temperature and pressure using nothing more than water and acid, but that process is energy-intensive. It might be possible to do it with a solar-heated reactor.\n\nWhat the “p” in pH stands for:\n\n“p” shows up in pH, pOH, pK a, pK b, and other things related to the concentration of H+ ions and OH- ions. The meaning of the\"p\" in\"pH\" has been the subject of much dispute. It is sometimes referred to as\"power of Hydrogen\", perhaps related to the fact that pH is a logarithmic scale, and the logarithm is the inverse of the exponented function and, in all three languages that pH was first published in, the word for\"potency\" is used for exponents. The term pH was introduced by Søren Peter Lauritz Sørensen, who did not publish his results in English, and more accurately translates as\"hydric exponent\". The letter p could stand for, in the languages in which Sørensen published: the French'puissance', German Potenz, or Danish potens, all referring to the concept of the\"exponent\" in exponential functions.\n\nTitle Text: Hydrogen Denier\n\nIn the title text, Randall claims to be an H + denier by refusing to consider loose protons to be hydrogen atoms, and as such, the “p” stands for pretend. Part of the joke is Randall's implication that this is a well-known conspiracy theory that he personally buys into (it isn't). The word\"denier\" is often used as shorthand for other conspiracy theories, such as a\"climate change denier\" or a\"moon landing denier.\"\n\nHere's a breakdown of this joke:\n\n<ul><li> H<sup>+<\/sup> is the chemical symbol for a positively-charged atom of hydrogen, the smallest atom on the Periodic Table. Since hydrogen is normally just one proton and one electron, when you take the electron away, you make it positively charged (the + sign in the superscript) and you effectively end up with just a single loose proton.

He has a purist's view of hydrogen, that it is just\"pretending\" to be hydrogen as soon as it loses an electron. As a denier, he interprets the term\"pH\" as referring to the concentration of\"pretend Hydrogen\".","comic_index":2943},{"URL":"https:\/\/www.explainxkcd.com\/wiki\/index.php\/2944","Publish date":"June 10, 2024","Explanation":"Magnet fishing is the act of using a magnet to find ferrometallic objects in a body of water. It can be used to recover specific lost items, help to clear a stretch of water of dumped items and\/or simply to see what interesting (perhaps valuable, occasionally dangerous) items can be found. This is reminiscent of magnetic fishing games (such as\"Let's Go Fishing\" and\"Go Fishing\") where players use fishing rods with small magnets on the ends to\"catch\" fish.\n\nThe comic imagines a World Magnet Fishing Championship, apparently only held once, because of the contestants' magnets getting stuck together. This resulted in the fishing lines becoming tangled together, or\"tied\", for a pun on the competition being declared\"tied\". It also looks like a tautology, though the first\"ten-way tie\" depicts how the ten lines are'knotted' together, and the second indicates the equality of the final score. This suggests that nobody'fished' anything other than\"all the other nine magnets\", prior to the inevitable conclusion.\n\nIt's unclear why the World Magnet Fishing Championship has contestants competing simultaneously. Participants go one at a time in a great variety of sporting competitions where the arena or venue only suits one competitor at a time -- such as diving, figure skating, gymnastics, equestrian -- and the individual performances are graded and compared to determine a winner. If the World Magnet Fishing Championship contestants took turns fishing from the bridge, it wouldn't have to be cancelled.\n\nThe title text states that the competition's prize would have been a\"fishing monopole\" which could refer to a fishing rod, also called a fishing pole, with only a single rod rather than multiple. Most fishing rods only have a single pole so this would not be considered rare. It could also refer to a magnet fishing rod where the magnet is a magnetic monopole rather than a magnetic dipole like all known magnets. This would certainly be rare since no magnetic monopoles have been found and thus would be a certainly be a valuable prize for a competition. The irony of this is that such a magnet would have alleviated the issue of the magnets attracting while fishing. The currently known laws of physics require that if magnetic monopoles exist, electric charge must be quantized. Electric charge is quantized which is consistent with (but does not prove) magnetic monopoles existing. Finally,'pole position' (usually in Motorsport) is awarded to the first place qualifier in a competition. With all competitors coming joint first, this is a'monopole' result.","comic_index":2944},{"URL":"https:\/\/www.explainxkcd.com\/wiki\/index.php\/2945","Publish date":"June 12, 2024","Explanation":"This comic shows Miss Lenhart explaining a mathematical model of a predator-prey relationship. The model has the terms swapped, showing that 400 rabbits are preying on 20 foxes. The teacher realizes this mistake and says\"If this were an ecology class, I would have to fix that.\" Instead of fixing the model, though, she instead begins to calculate using this flawed model, and notes that this model implies that rabbits are carnivores.\n\nThe equations start with N rabbits (0)=400 and N foxes (0)=20, the number of rabbits and foxes at time 0, followed by what looks like the Lotka–Volterra equations, a pair of first-order nonlinear differential equations, frequently used to describe the dynamics of biological systems in which two species interact. One of the pair of equations describes the number of prey over time, the other the number of predators over time, differing only by a negative sign (and coefficients). It is easy to mix up which equation describes which species, leading to the inverted predator-prey relation described.\n\nIf this was indeed the case the rabbits would likely soon render the foxes extinct. They might not, if each rabbit requires to eat a very small amount of fox, and they hunt in packs, so that a single fox feeds many rabbits, but it would need to be a very small amount, very infrequently. The reason this doesn't happen in reality for rabbits is that they outnumber the foxes (20 foxes vs 400 rabbits) and thus enough of them can survive being preyed upon to maintain the species. Often the predator takes the old and sick animals first, thus keeping the rest of the animals more healthy. But following the math of the wrong formula would soon lead to zero foxes. As per the title text, the rabbits could survive without the foxes to prey on, since they still eat grass (assuming that there is not some specific nutrition requirement that is only fulfilled by the foxes). However, this reality is terrifying for the foxes, because they are rendered as prey.\n\nThe title text extends the joke by looking at an even more flawed model that incorporates grass. In the real world, rabbits eat grass and foxes do not directly interact with grass. In this model, the fox-eating rabbits also continue to eat grass and foxes do interact with grass. Even more unfortunately for them, this is in the form of the grass eating foxes, creating a\"Fox Hell\".\n\nAs a matter of fact, grass pulls nutrients from air and soil and synthesizes its energy through photosynthesis, and may use foxes that have already died from other causes as fertilizer. Foxes do occasionally eat grass, although not as food, but for other health reasons.","comic_index":2945},{"URL":"https:\/\/www.explainxkcd.com\/wiki\/index.php\/2946","Publish date":"June 14, 2024","Explanation":"Abraham Lincoln's Gettysburg Address features the phrase\"four score and seven\"‍ to refer to 87: a\"score\" is a group of 20, which literally translates as\"four-twenties [and] seven\". This is because English used to count by twenties (and some modern languages, including French still do, at least partially). However, this practice has died off and most English speakers nowadays would not use\"score\" in such a manner. Inspired by this, Cueball (possibly representing Randall) decides to use unusual prefixes to state the population of a town.\n\nMetric prefixes can be added to a unit to scale up or down its magnitude. For example,\" kilo-\" means\"multiply by 1000\", so a kilometer is as long as 1,000 meters. These prefixes are added to various metric units but, due to their usefulness, have been adopted and added to other, non-metric units, such as\"kilocubic feet per second\" (for the flow rate of a liquid, much to Randall's chagrin when researching for his book\"XKCD What-If\"),\"megadeath\" (how many millions killed in an estimated nuclear blast), or the\" millihelen\" (the amount of feminine beauty needed to launch a ship). Most potentially confusing might be\"kilo-\/mega-\/giga-\/terabyte\", which has competing definitions. However, they're not ordinarily added before number words to change their magnitude.\n\nTaking\"kilofive\" to be a unit meaning 5,000, the population of East Hills, 6,000, can therefore be expressed as 1.2 kilofives. But phrasing a number this way requires the listener to make excess calculations to understand it, so White Hat would probably get confused or annoyed.\n\nIt is somewhat common for metric prefixes to go after numbers in abbreviations. Well-known examples are\" Y2K\" for\"year 2000\", and\" 4K resolution\" for\"4,000 [pixels]\". The number 5,000 may be abbreviated as\" 5K\" in\" 5K resolution\". However, the'postfix' (suffix) may be intended to modify the implied but unstated unit, where there is an obvious one, or stand for the unit itself in such cases as the word\"kilometer\" (often abbreviated to \/ˈkeɪ\/(s), in common use, in phrases such as\" 5K run\") or\" kilo pixel\" (in this case referencing the horizontal resolution, as in 5120 × 2880 pixels, rather than prior usages such as the 1080 horizontal lines in the standard known as 1080p, or the total area pixel count in'megapixel'\/'gigapixel' image sensors), thus making it directly stand for a prefixed unit itself, as an adjunct to the standard common shortening of\"kilos\" for, usually,\"kilograms\". Saying\"1.2 5K\" could be even more awkward, liable to be misunderstood as\"1.25k\" (1,250) instead of the value of 6000.\n\nIn the title text, Cueball has apparently annoyed White Hat with his confusing expressions of numbers, but he doubles down, now directly including the word\"score\". He is riffing on the common expression,\"give me one reason why...\" but instead of simply asking for one reason, he asks for 50 milliscore reasons, or 50 × 1⁄1000 × 20, which is equal to 1.\n\nThe comic might refer to the village of East Hills, New York. As of the 2020 census, it had a population of 7,284, or 1.214 kilosixes.","comic_index":2946},{"URL":"https:\/\/www.explainxkcd.com\/wiki\/index.php\/2947","Publish date":"June 17, 2024","Explanation":"The comic is a conflation of Pascal's Wager and Pascal's Triangle. It's structured as a layout that emulates Pascal's triangle, an infinite triangle of numbers where the top number is 1 and each value below is the sum of the adjacent number(s) above it. The second row has two 1s (each the sum of the single 1 above), and the third row has a 1 (the sum of a single 1 in the second row), a 2 (the sum of both 1s above it), and another 1, and so on. It plays important roles in binomial expansion, probability theory, and other areas of math. While Blaise Pascal did not invent the triangle, it is named after him (an example of Stigler's law of eponymy).\n\nPascal's Wager is a philosophical argument proposed by the same Pascal. Essentially it says that if God exists, both the rewards for believing in God and the punishment for nonbelief are infinite; if not, the cost of belief and benefit for nonbelief are negligible. Therefore, if there is a finite possibility that God exists, however small, one should believe in God. One problem with that is that there may be more than one God to believe in, even if only one truly exists. Which one of all the possible Gods should you choose to believe in could be problematic, if the real God insists that you only believe in Him and punishes you for believing in any other gods (even if you somehow also believed in Him). A further problem is that committing to any particular belief in a deity is not a totally zero cost option, and thus affects your life in many needless ways if you subscribe to any particular practice of religion not actually required by any extant god(s), even if any of them exist in the first place.\n\nThe comic merges the two Pascalian concepts: each Cueball is wagering his proof of a god or gods to the Cueballs below him, thereby creating Cueballs that believe in the sum of the number of gods of the Cueballs above them. In the second row, the two Cueballs each believe in one god, as intended by the original Cueball. However, in the third row, the Cueball in the middle interprets the two proofs offered to him as proving the existence of two gods. Theoretically, this expansion would continue for all integers as the triangle grows, giving rise to a belief in escalating numbers of gods going down and towards the middle of the triangle. This is clearly not the intent of the first Cueball, who simply offered a proof of his one god, but he has no control over the situation below him.\n\nIt is unclear why the Cueballs behave in this fashion, instead of treating all the proofs as proving the existence of the same god. Perhaps each one rewords their arguments for god(s) sufficiently to make them sound different than other gods. This is not without precedent. Scholars of comparative mythology believe that the religion of Proto-Indo-European peoples splintered into many disparate religions of Europe and West Asia; for instance, Dyeus phter (sky father) became Zeus in Greece and Jupiter in Italy.\n\nThis comic may be referencing a common counterargument to Pascal's Wager — that it works equally well for any hypothetical god which offers eternal paradise for one action and eternal damnation otherwise. This can even include hypothetical gods with contradictory criteria for entrance into paradise. In this case, the Cueballs apparently chose to believe in all the deities they've heard of in order to cover their bases.\n\nThe title text suggests that everyone should draw a proper Pascal's Triangle, since there is a possibility that God wants you to do so, and if they do then the benefits of pleasing God or the costs of displeasing God could be high, whereas if they have no such desire then there is minimal cost to drawing one anyway. The failing of this logic is that God may have a positive preference for you not to draw a Pascal's Triangle (though at least according to the Catholic Church this is unlikely, as Pascal himself is on the way to beatification.)\n\nPascal's Wager was previously mentioned in the title text of 525: I Know You're Listening.","comic_index":2947},{"URL":"https:\/\/www.explainxkcd.com\/wiki\/index.php\/2948","Publish date":"June 19, 2024","Explanation":"Internal combustion engines (ICEs) have long been the most common technology used to propel motor vehicles (usually in the specific form of reciprocating\"piston\" engines). In US vernacular, the most common vehicle fuel is known as\" gasoline\", or\"gas\" for short, leading to these engines being referred to as\"gas engines\". Gasoline is a product of petroleum refinement, leading to the name\"petrol\" being used in other dialects.\n\nElectric motors would seem the more well-suited method for propelling a vehicle, and as early as 1885 were an actual form of motor car engine with which the fledgling internal combustion engine had to compete. Despite this early popularity, over most of the 20th century electric motors were sidelined in everyday car design, as supplying the electricity was considered to be impractical for most forms of transportation. Modern forms are rapidly rising in popularity, and now constitute 18% of all global vehicle sales. Randall is a strong proponent of electric vehicles (EVs).\n\nIn this strip, White Hat claims to be comparing the pros and cons of electric motors and gas engines. The joke is that every point he makes goes in favor of electric motors. Despite it being posed as a dilemma, it may be very clear which side of the debate White Hat is promoting. On the other hand, it may indicate that one of the things we might consider a pro in electric motors (the instantaneous power now available, exceeding that of many non-electric engines) he would consider a problem — perhaps more accurately, a problem with the drivers of such vehicles — recklessly using the enhanced capabilities to accelerate to high speeds at all opportunities, whether safe to do so or not.\n\nThe strip offers the following points in favor of electric motors:\n\n<ul><li> \"Cleaner and more efficient\". ICEs produce and vent harmful combustion products and toxic chemicals, while electric motors produce no emission byproducts at the point of use. The efficiency of both gas and electric motors vary, but the typical ICE vehicle in the US converts around 25% of available energy into motion, while the typical electric vehicle is in the neighborhood of 80%. Even when considering inefficiencies in the source production and transmission and storage and release of energy, battery-driven electric vehicles are generally more efficient than internal combustion propelled vehicles<a class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"https:\/\/www.factcheck.org\/2024\/02\/electric-vehicles-contribute-fewer-emissions-than-gasoline-powered-cars-over-their-lifetimes\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">[1]<\/a>.\n<ul><li> It should be noted that all of this refers to the motors only, and ignores how the fuel and electricity are produced, or the wider environmental impact of the vehicle. Electric vehicles are also more environmentally friendly in this aspect, as many renewable power sources are available (including solar, wind, hydro, nuclear, etc), and that grid-scale power production even with fossil fuels is much more efficient than individual small engines in every vehicle.<\/li><\/ul><\/li><\/ul>\n\n<ul><li> \"More powerful\". Electric motors are able to deliver a lot of power from a small motor <i>if<\/i> an ample energy supply is available, and can do so 'on demand', often far quicker than a fuel-powered engine that has to put its power through a gearbox in order to service a wide range of road velocities, from standstill to the eventual top speed. Due to battery limitations, short or partial runtime use cases (such as dragsters, hand tools, yard tools, toys and electric scooters) net the most benefit from the small size of a high-powered electric motor.  <\/li><\/ul>\n\n<ul><li> \"Annoyingly loud\". ICEs, by their nature, produce significant noise. Despite noise attenuation measures such as mufflers, they contribute significantly to urban noise. Properly designed electric motors are nearly silent (even if the rest of the vehicle is not). In particular, <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Blowoff_valve\" title=\"wikipedia:Blowoff valve\">turbocharger blowoff valves<\/a> make particular noises that are completely lacking in an all-electric vehicle being driven at a similar performance level. This might legitimately be considered a problem, though, when everyone is used to a rapidly approaching vehicle providing a very noisy warning of its approach. EV makers have sometimes added <a class=\"external text\" href=\"https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/electric-car-ev-fake-engine-sound-hyundai-dodge-toyota-2023-7\" rel=\"nofollow\">fake ICE noises<\/a> to appeal to older drivers, and in the U.S. and some other countries, EVs are required to have <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Electric_vehicle_warning_sounds\" title=\"wikipedia:Electric vehicle warning sounds\">warning sounds<\/a> at low speeds for pedestrian safety.\n<ul><li> At highway speeds, the noise of tires against the road is much louder than a properly muffled ICE, so the intrinsic quietness of an EV's motor is close to irrelevant in that context.<\/li><\/ul><\/li><\/ul>\n\n<ul><li> \"WAY less <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Torque\" title=\"wikipedia:Torque\">torque<\/a> available at standstill\". ICEs need to continually operate within a specific range of rotational speeds for best power and fuel efficiency (although the reciprocating engines used in most motor vehicles are still better than some others, such as <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Gas_turbine\" title=\"wikipedia:Gas turbine\">gas turbine<\/a> engines, in this regard), which means that a complex system of <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Transmission\" title=\"wikipedia:Transmission\">transmission gearing<\/a> is needed to convert this motion into the specific speeds needed at the wheels. When starting from a standstill, this means that torque must be applied to the wheels relatively gradually to avoid stalling the engine. In addition, when a vehicle is standing still, the motor is typically idling at (very) low speed and must be sped up before it produces significant acceleration. Electric motors, in contrast, generally produce their peak torque when at a standstill. This results in electric vehicles having significantly better acceleration and engine responsiveness. Again, this could cause a legitimate problem with drivers changing from ICE to electric motors, because the new cars accelerate more than the driver is used to and provide different feedback. The audible clues of gear changes, whether from automatic or manual systems, are part and parcel of what many people have grown up with and come to rely on in anticipating what might need paying attention to.<\/li><\/ul>\n\nIt should be noted that White Hat is deliberately confining his arguments to electric vs gas motors rather than electric or gas-powered vehicles. Doing so ignores the basic reason why internal combustion vehicles have long dominated transportation in certain specific countries: hydrocarbon fuels are a very dense and fairly easy to handle form of energy storage. Providing electrical power to a moving vehicle requires either that the vehicle remain in contact with a power line (as with an electric train or a tram) or else to carry a high-capacity battery (and the ability to recharge that battery in a reasonable amount of time, while stationary). More popular in the USA is a hybrid system, where a combustion engine provides at least some of the power to an electric motor, which was impractical until comparatively recently. Other methods, such as hydrogen fuel cells (a form of\"combustion\" that can be used more directly to form electricity), have been proposed, but remain experimental or niche, due to various barriers to adoption.\n\nA more comprehensive comparison would include many more factors, both against and in favor of electric cars.\n\nIssues raised with electric vehicles typically include:\n\n<ul><li> Higher cost of purchase (primarily due to the cost of batteries and, in the USA, now a 100% tariff on Chinese EVs), although partially offset by lower costs of operation<\/li>\n<li> Long charging times compared to refilling a gas tank (there are some approaches which mitigate this by operating either very high-powered chargers or a battery swap model, rather than charging in-car, but these are not widely adopted)\n<ul><li>It's important to note, however, that for most human people that occasionally need food or to use the bathroom, the charging times are a non-issue, as most drivers will welcome a short 5-15 minute break after several hours of driving as their car charges.<\/li><\/ul><\/li>\n<li> Relatively limited range (<a class=\"external text\" href=\"https:\/\/ev-database.org\/compare\/electric-vehicle-longest-range\" rel=\"nofollow\">200-500 miles per charge<\/a> as of 2024, though this limitation applies to most gas vehicles as well, where 300 mile range is typical)<\/li>\n<li> Shortened range in hot weather and significantly shortened range in cold weather (while all vehicles have this problem, it's more pronounced in EVs compared to ICEs)<\/li>\n<li> Limited charging infrastructure compared to the prevalence of fuel stations\n<ul><li> Because many drivers can charge at home, fewer public chargers are needed than for gas cars.<\/li><\/ul><\/li>\n<li> Higher vehicle weight, and resulting higher particulate emissions (from tires, but not brakes, because EVs use of regenerative braking reduces wear on their traditional brakes)<\/li>\n<li> Reliance on some mineral and metal extraction industries (e.g., lithium) with capacity that lags the recent increased demands for EVs<\/li>\n<li> Increased demand on electricity production<\/li>\n<li> <a class=\"external text\" href=\"https:\/\/archive.is\/6xmJV\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lower reliability<\/a>(data possibly skewed by the <a class=\"external text\" href=\"https:\/\/community.cartalk.com\/t\/should-i-still-avoid-the-first-model-year-of-a-new-vehicle\/118110\" rel=\"nofollow\">newness of EV models<\/a>).<\/li><\/ul>\n\nOther real pros of electric cars are also not mentioned:\n\n<ul><li> Lower total cost of ownership (TCO)<a class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"https:\/\/www.edf.org\/sites\/default\/files\/2023-0\/WSP%20Total%20Cost%20of%20Ownership%20Analysis%20July%202023.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">[2]<\/a><\/li>\n<li> Can \"fill\" them at home or while parked without having to stay with them (partially negates the \"long charging times\" con)<\/li>\n<li> Lower carbon footprint, and reduced dependence on the fossil fuel industry<\/li><\/ul>\n\nRapidly evolving technologies, government policies, and economic realities are changing the relevance and seriousness of these points over time. As of the publication of this strip, the\"pros\" of EVs do not seem to be universally convincing, as ICEs remain far more popular than EVs in most countries (EVs constitute a majority of new vehicle sales in only four countries: Norway, Iceland, Sweden and Finland). That said, EVs didn't exist as a viable industry 20 years ago, so the current reality reflects rapid and ongoing growth, suggesting that the advantages of EVs are gaining increasing recognition and understanding.\n\nThe degree of adoption is also likely to impact the viability of different vehicle types. Infrastructure in most countries has long been built around an assumption of ICEs, so things like fueling stations and ICE-qualified mechanics have traditionally been widely accessible. As EVs becoming increasingly dominant, this could shift, with EV charging infrastructure becoming easier to find than ICE fueling stations, and ICE mechanics potentially becoming more difficult to find. There's typically a certain level of inertia in the adoption of any new technology.\n\nIn the EU, the sale of new ICE cars is banned from 2035 in an effort to move to EVs, and other jurisdictions are adopting similar policies.\n\nEspecially in the United States, this topic is highly contentious for political, economic, engineering, and tribal reasons (as a quick look at the edit history of this page will confirm).\n\nThere are other areas where a similar pretend tradeoff could be implied when the electric option actually has all of the advantages. For example, electric stoves are faster and more efficient than natural gas stoves, but this is the price to pay for the lack of noxious nitrogen oxides released during combustion.","comic_index":2948},{"URL":"https:\/\/www.explainxkcd.com\/wiki\/index.php\/2949","Publish date":"June 21, 2024","Explanation":"In this comic, Cueball takes an uncommon networking bug - needing to establish a fresh connection for each packet sent - to the extreme. Instead of merely redoing the appropriate handshakes for data transfer, he is reconstructing the entire history of human civilization each time. As this originally took multiple millennia, doing it for every network packet would make communication extremely slow; in modern networking, we send and receive thousands of packets every second.\n\nRandall may be using a double meaning of the word\"rebuild.\" Instead of just rebuilding his network settings - starting fresh with a clean setup - he is rebuilding civilization itself from scratch, an extreme type of\"first principles thinking.\"\n\nIn the last frame of the comic, Cueball looks shaggy and dirty and has a grub hoe behind him, making it clear he is performing these tasks in real life just to get his network working again. He says the network packet was stuck in the Neolithic era, the final period of the Stone Age that marked the transition from hunter-gatherer lifestyle to one of settlement. Apparently, Cueball had to go through the effort of inventing farming (one of the developments of the Neolithic Revolution) to keep communicating with Ponytail. He has also had to build himself a new wooden chair (and possibly desk), and hasn't yet got to the point of developing a notebook computer, so is using an under-desk tower PC connected to a chunky monitor. Presumably his previous equipment and furniture were lost in resetting to the Neolithic, though this seems to have been a localized effect, given that Ponytail appears unaffected.\n\n\"Inventing farming takes forever\" references the actual rather complex process of inventing farming. First, we needed the last Ice Age to end - around 11,000 years ago - to create suitable climatic environments for agriculture. Then we required advancements in plant cultivation, animal domestication, and tool development - lots of time and experimentation involved there. And the transition from hunter-gatherer societies to sedentary farming communities also needed significant social and cultural adaptations (e.g., new organizational structures).\n\nRandall Munroe is familiar with the popular creative nonfiction topic of what it takes to rebuild civilization, the subject of a book he blurbed on its cover, How to Invent Everything, by Ryan North, fellow cartoonist.\n\n<ul><li> The topic of rebuilding a civilization from scratch was also referenced in comic <a href=\"\/wiki\/index.php\/1380:_Manual_for_Civilization\" title=\"1380: Manual for Civilization\">1380: Manual for Civilization<\/a> and in the title text of <a href=\"\/wiki\/index.php\/2347:_Dependency\" title=\"2347: Dependency\">2347: Dependency<\/a>.<\/li><\/ul>\n\nThe title text discusses netcat, a simple utility to make a TCP connection which comes in annoyingly incompatible nc.traditional and nc.openbsd varieties.\n\nIn addition, the tendency for civilizations to independently develop netcat may be an allusion to The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, in which 85% of all planets invariably develop a cocktail whose name is, by pure coincidence, a phonetic homophone to “gin and tonic”, such as the Jynnan tonnyx, while varying wildly in composition. The word\"netcat\" is a composite of\"net\" (most likely standing for network each time, although could relate to some form of mesh\/trap, a topology or an amount less any deductions), while\"cat\" may be an abbreviation (for example for catalogue, category, catalyst, catastrophe etc.), or even actually referring to a cat. The various possible combinations could encompass a wide variation in function of similarly named processes.","comic_index":2949},{"URL":"https:\/\/www.explainxkcd.com\/wiki\/index.php\/2950","Publish date":"June 24, 2024","Explanation":"This comic depicts a situation involving multiple pieces of infrastructure: a ship, sailing towards icebergs, which is tethered to an airship flying next to a power plant towards a bridge. Each of these are labelled with details that clearly reference famous disasters, all of which were caused (at least in part) by design failures. All of these incidents are common case studies for engineers studying how things can go very wrong. The implication is that, by putting them all together, most engineers would be highly concerned with the potential for catastrophe.\n\nAs illustrated, it appears that the ship is about to sail under the bridge, while the airship will fly over it, causing the tether between the two to snag the bridge unless the airship descends sufficiently before then.

Maps of individual countries are common, especially in academic settings. It is typical for such maps, which only display a limited area of the globe, to use a projection that does not severely distort the shape of the country or its internal borders, but a country that is large enough (as with the United States) will always noticeably suffer from certain distortions of at least one element chosen from distances, areas or angles. This usually occurs at its extremities (though some projections can be made more faithful to its extremities at the expense of distorting its interior).\n\nHere, however, Randall has opted for a much different projection. Rather than placing the geographical center of the country in the middle and the borders on the outside, this map has gone the opposite direction, with the border of the US toward the center, and the geographical center of the contiguous US (Kansas) and surrounding states distorted to surround the entire map. This, understandably, results in the shape of both the national and state borders being largely unrecognizable as it effectively puts every bit of the chosen map features out towards the distorted extremities. Much of the internal area of Kansas itself (should one wish to display further internal features) may be located far beyond the comic's edges, perhaps even to infinitely far away on the projected plane.\n\nIf Alaska and Hawaii were present in this map and represented in geographically accurate locations (as opposed to inset, as is common in many maps of the United States), Alaska would in the upper right of the empty space, between Minnesota and Washington, while Hawaii would be in the center to the right, off the coast of California. Both would be rather small, with Hawaii particularly compressed (to an extent dictated by the exact projection method used). Additionally, if all 50 states were included, the geographical center would be further to the northwest, resulting in an\"Exterior South Dakota\" projection.\n\nThe title text refers to the fact that the geographic center of the contiguous United States is within Kansas. This map projection instead causes Kansas to show up as the exterior of the US, which makes it the outer edge.\n\nThe statement that topologists now believe it's actually their outer edge plays with the notion that map projections influence your perspective on the world, as it is known to be the case with more familiar examples like Mercator vs. Gall-Peters projections, or world maps with the South Pole on top and so on. Similarly, or so the claim goes, any notions of interior and edge may just be a matter of perspective.\nIf you were to enclose a small square in four walls, but define this to be the outside, you'd effectively create a roofless building of which the floor area encompasses almost the entire surface of the Earth (minus the small square) - see So Long And Thanks For All The Fish by Douglas Adams for a classic example of this gag. Randall has always been fond of exploring how map projections influence our perspective both in a parodistic way and by playing it straight, e.g. in: 503: Terminology, 977: Map Projections, or 2838: Dubious Islands","comic_index":2951},{"URL":"https:\/\/www.explainxkcd.com\/wiki\/index.php\/2952","Publish date":"June 28, 2024","Explanation":"This comic is almost certainly a reference to chapter 9 of the book The Little Prince by Antoine de Saint-Exupéry. On the first page the following quote can be found:\"On the morning of his departure he put his planet in perfect order. He carefully cleaned out his active volcanoes.\"\n\nA recommended routine maintenance step for many electronics, such as desktop computer towers, is to remove the buildup of dust on a regular basis. This can help prevent the electrical components from overheating, and lengthen their lifetime. To make this job easier, safer, and cleaner, there exist cans of high-pressure gas, as depicted, which force through high-flow gas to displace the dust. (Attempting to do this with air from the lungs would be less effective, may add unintended moisture to the electronics, and could result in a face-full of dust. [ citation needed])\n\nThe comic suggests that a similar maintenance step is performed on the Earth itself, blowing gas into the Earth to force out the dust from its magma chambers. However, filling the atmosphere with dust would be unhealthy and fatal to living beings, so as a safety measure everyone would have to take shelter.\n\nThis may be a reference to one theory about the K-T extinction event — that a crashing meteor sent so much dust into the air that it killed off many plants and animals, including all non-avian dinosaurs, in a much wider area than that directly affected by the initial impact. Those lineages that chanced to survive the global effects must have been able to escape the worst of the disrupted ecosphere while the worst of the atmospheric effects subsided, and were then able to exploit various newly vacant (and\/or changed) environmental niches. (This would include our own mammalian ancestors, and the avian dinosaurs that led to todays birds; some of them may, perhaps, have survived by already being more inclined\/suited to living in burrows.) However, this dust cloud would have lasted longer than the 48 hours suggested in the comic.\n\nThe image suggests that the\"routine maintenance\" for Earth would involve using the Hawaii hotspot (possibly via its most active volcano, Kilauea), as the point to insert the high-pressure gas, causing volcanoes to erupt in Iceland, the Aleutian Islands or the Kamchatka Peninsula, the Andes, and elsewhere; the two geographically-indeterminate plumes may represent Italy and Indonesia.\n\nThe title text mentions using the can upside-down, and this freezing solid the magma chambers. Pressurized canisters of\"air\", as with similar aerosol sprayers, contain a propellant gas that condenses into a liquid when compressed. When the spray valve is opened, the release of pressure allows some of the liquid to evaporate and take the place of the released gases, or become some of the gas subsequently released (or all of it, if its purpose is not to spray other contents). The transition of the propellant liquid\/gas from dense liquid to space-filling gas requires it to'boil off', this process needing to pick up heat (or'enthalpy') energy. Under typical operation, the cooling liquid\/gas takes heat from the general mass of the can itself as it tries to attain thermal equilibrium. As a result, the can (and the expelled gases) will be cooled a little. Then (ultimately) heat will also be taken from anything touching or surrounding the slightly cooled can and its spray. This is precisely how a purposeful refrigerant acts, either as a one-time process or as a reversible cycle where re-pressurizing a suitable gas can'release' heat (the heat\/enthalpy of condensation) at the'hot side' of a refrigerator, returning the gas in the system to liquid that it can later let boil again and cool the'cold side' of the refrigerator.\n\nIt is not normally useful for such a can to allow the liquid propellant-in-waiting to exit the container, as it would waste its usefulness as a source of pressure once it does. But by holding the container the wrong way up (which way that is being dependent upon its design, and intended use...) the pressurized contents push the liquid out via the nozzle's stream. The now exposed propellant is now free to evaporate into the air at atmospheric pressure, typically much lower than the constraints it had within the can, after landing directly upon whatever the can was sprayed at. The resulting demand for heat energy (much more rapid than normal, and likely concentrated upon a much smaller target than the can itself represents) produces a greater localized drop in temperature and can lead to freezing nearby liquids (which may or may not be intended\/useful). Of course, the total'cooling effect' of such a can does not change, depending upon how it is (mis)used, it merely changes the extent (and lifetime) of application, and how extreme the temperature change may be within a much more limited'liberation' of its cooling ability.\n\nSpraying\"canned air\" with the can inverted is a party trick used to very quickly cool beverages, being able to bring them down from room temperature to ice cold in seconds if performed correctly.\n\nSome spray cans are designed to freeze objects, e.g. to help in plumbing repairs or finding overheating electronic components. Freeze spray is also used in medical applications. These require careful use to avoid unintentionally (or intentionally!) damaging exposed skin or objects that can be damaged by local temperature differences, such as glass.\n\nGiven the location of the planetary-scale dust-busting'air canister', it may be considered confusing which'way up' is the correct orientation, given that Earth-gravity would be pulling the contents sideways (however that changes what the nozzle ends up ejecting from the can itself). But such a large can would also have its own significant internal'can-centric' gravity that possibly (depending upon how full of still-liquid propellant it is) exceeds that of the Moon, possibly letting all the denser liquid hold itself into the centre of the canister, even against the nearby Earth's gravity. Being significantly closer to the Earth than the Moon is, this can could also be a far greater influence upon Earth's own tides (not alluded to in the comic), making the dusting of the atmosphere or the freezing of some of its magma secondary issues to the sheltering population. But if magma froze to the extent of disrupting or disabling the Earth's magnetic field, this\"secondary\" issue could quickly become primary, even existential.\n\nThree comics after this one Randall released 2955: Pole Vault, where the Earth is being punctured by the tip of a pole vaulting stick causing the Earth to burst like a ballon. That idea seems to be similar, but opposite the one from this comic. With so few days between the releases there might have been some similar thoughts behind the creation of both.","comic_index":2952},{"URL":"https:\/\/www.explainxkcd.com\/wiki\/index.php\/2953","Publish date":"July 1, 2024","Explanation":"This comic is making fun of conspiracy theorists who believe alien life is spying on Earth, by making aliens who are actually in contact with Earth into conspiracy theorists themselves.\n\nA cultural phenomenon on Earth is based on the concept that unidentified flying objects (UFOs) represent visitors from extraterrestrial civilizations (aliens), to the extent that\"UFO\" may be considered entirely synonymous with\"alien spacecraft\", rather than the more basic truth of just not having yet been recognized as anything in particular. In the USA, these are now officially termed\"unidentified anomalous\/aerial phenomena\" (UAPs), in an attempt to mitigate this type of automatic association, although there are already those who readily adopt the new term as equally indicative of their old opinions.\n\nBeing unidentified, there could be many trivial reasons (and a few still very interesting non-trivial ones) that could be the truth of any particular observation, without needing to invoke the presence of aliens. But those who believe that UFOs\/UAPs are extraterrestrial spacecraft may respond to those who reject this idea with the line,\"These objects have capabilities superior to ours, it would be foolish not to investigate,\" especially in cases where astounding speeds and maneuverability are apparently observed (however much they may be more trivial phenomena, such as camera movement, glints off lenses, or other optical effects) or conveyed by uncorroborated witness statements\n\nThis comic attributes the\"foolish not to investigate\" line to bona fide flying saucers who have chosen to make direct communication with Earth, represented by Cueball (who seems to calmly accept their presence). Whereas skeptical humans may confront UFO believers with evidence that their belief in aliens is unfounded, and argue that it is pointless to continue to promote theories (conspiracy or otherwise) about them, Cueball confronts the flying saucers with evidence that aliens do exist (in the form of themselves), and therefore promoting further unsubstantiated theories would seem redundant in the first degree.\n\nThe aliens we see would surely know which vague terrestrial observations were actually of themselves, and could certainly confirm the existence of themselves in the first place, but seem to conclude that various other'unidentified' observations on Earth are mysteries worthy of their own wild speculation, concluding that anything that doesn't conform to their own known abilities must be an (additional) alien visitation of some kind. Cueball is annoyed that the occupants of the flying saucers maintain their unfounded beliefs despite lack of solid evidence. Possibly these are the same aliens who are also shown to be credulous regarding cryptids. They reflect the situation of (human) UFO believers, who maintain their beliefs despite the absence of evidence. The aliens also maintain their beliefs in such tenuous observations, despite even the depicted aliens themselves maintaining that those other events were nothing to do with them. (Though human presumptions about the existence of aliens would, as it turns out, be shown to be correct in cases such as this particular encounter.)\n\nThe title text reports that the extraterrestrials have had no better luck finding evidence for conspiracy theories about\"chemtrails\" ( vapor trails) than have humans, concluding that they are just water\/ice particles after testing collected samples. Chemtrails are supposed clouds of gas or other substances deployed by commercial airplanes, which are used to mind-control the population or in some way alter the human population or the environment (depending on who you ask). They have been mentioned before on xkcd. Ironically the origin of the ice mentioned in the title text is jet exhaust — if you burn a hydrocarbon (such as the components of jet fuel) the main products will be carbon dioxide and water. At the temperatures and pressures it is released, the water will mostly turn to ice as it nucleates under the local temperature and pressure conditions. However, a significant fraction will later sublimate.","comic_index":2953},{"URL":"https:\/\/www.explainxkcd.com\/wiki\/index.php\/2954","Publish date":"July 3, 2024","Explanation":"Brackets, also called parentheses, are typographical symbols used to delimit a section of text.

The comic precedes any of the actual official competitions (or indeed the official Opening Ceremony) by three weeks, but perhaps this event (and the javelin one) occurred at one or other of the attending nations' training camps, or national trials for a local athletics squad, already established in the general region. Alternatively, this is simply depicting future events.\n\nThree comics before this one Randall released 2952: Routine Maintenance, where the Earth is being subject to a routine maintenance by pushing the tip of a high pressure canister into Earth and blowing air into Earth to expel debris from inside Earth's volcanoes. That idea seems to be similar, but opposite to the one from this comic, in that here the Earth is a soft stretchable surface enclosing a pressurised gaseous interior, whereas in the previous comic it was a hard shell with gas filled cavities open to the exterior. With so few days between the releases there might have been some similar thoughts behind the creation of both.","comic_index":2955},{"URL":"https:\/\/www.explainxkcd.com\/wiki\/index.php\/2956","Publish date":"July 8, 2024","Explanation":"This comic likens the number line to a line of a railroad or subway system. These often have branches where different trains continue on to a different destination, with different stops along the way, or travel on parallel lines to allow faster trains to bypass slower ones. In the number line, one branch (presumably the original) contains ordinary integers, while the newly opened branch consists of some completely different numbers, denoted with various symbols as an analogue to those we use as digits. The branches seem to split around π. The new branch maintains the same distance between numbers as the'normal' one (as far as it goes) but, due to a longer initial curve away from the junction, the digits of the new branch are also consistently offset slightly to the left from the horizontal positions of the respective digits of the normal branch.\n\nThe new branch ending with a bold mark at Δ (whereas the original number line fades out after 10) suggests that it is the end of this branching sequence. Mathematicians, apparently, could only afford to construct 5 additional numbers, or their research hasn't yet found other numbers. The branch may have been intended to run much further, but it was possibly scaled back due to budget overruns and cutbacks.\n\nThe title text makes a parallel between a train stopping at a station and a numerical sequence\"stopping\" at a number – that is, taking it as a value. It's a spoof of announcements that are typically made on trains, so that passengers can confirm that they're on a train that goes to their desired station; an\"express train\" typically makes fewer stops so it can serve the most popular stops and reach its final destination sooner. In this case, the express train only stops at powers of 2; presumably the\"local\" train stops at every integer. Powers of 2 are 2, 4, 8, 16, 32,..., 2 n, such that the interval between stops grows exponentially larger.\n\nMathematically, an express train like this would get to its scheduled stops much faster, but it would not actually have any fewer stops overall. Mathematicians that study infinities generally regard all\" countably\" infinite sets as being the same size (containing the same number of elements). Infinity is not a fixed value; rather, it's the concept of\"does not end\", so it's paradoxical to try to take a train to a destination that is, by definition, not a single destination. By way of analogue, it's akin to promising to stop hitting your little brother only after you've done so forever.\n\nThis same property of infinite numbers (that all countably infinite sets are the same size) also means that adding the new branch does not increase how many numbers the system can handle. This is similar to the phenomenon of induced demand in transit, where expanding the capacity for a road or train system frequently results in demand rising back up to capacity, becoming just as congested as it was before.\n\nA fictional number was previously shown in 899: Number Line (\"gird\"), and fictional numerals were shown in 2206: Mavis Beacon. Similar treatment of mathematics as public infrastructure was seen in 2735: Coordinate Plane Closure.","comic_index":2956},{"URL":"https:\/\/www.explainxkcd.com\/wiki\/index.php\/2957","Publish date":"July 10, 2024","Explanation":"\n\n\n\n\n\n<table class=\"notice_tpl\" style=\"background-color: white; border: 1px solid #aaa; box-shadow: 2px 2px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2); border-left: 10px solid #1E90FF; margin: 0 auto;\">\n<tr>\n<td> <img alt=\"warning!!.png\" height=\"35\" src=\"\/wiki\/images\/thumb\/4\/4a\/warning%21%21.png\/40px-warning%21%21.png\" srcset=\"\/wiki\/images\/thumb\/4\/4a\/warning%21%21.png\/60px-warning%21%21.png 1.5x, \/wiki\/images\/thumb\/4\/4a\/warning%21%21.png\/80px-warning%21%21.png 2x\" width=\"40\"\/>\n<\/td>\n<td style=\"padding:0 1em\"> <big><b>SPOILER ALERT!<\/b><\/big><br\/>Stop scrolling!

For example, a webserver with such a bug might allow a user of a web page to make it run a program that deletes system files or displays private information.\n\nThe joke arising from this comic is that if you remove the\"e\" from\"code\", you get\"remote cod execution\". This refers to killing (\"executing\") codfish remotely, using an exploit in a network application that allows one to view and interact with the hatchery.\n\nThe title text contains a pun on rainbow tables, referring to rainbow trout, one type of which ( steelhead) is anadromous (migrating up rivers to spawn -- salmon are another well known example). Rainbow tables are used when trying to crack hashed passwords; these are files with a carefully pre-computed selection of passwords and their corresponding hash values, which can be used to more efficiently recover passwords that are provided only in their hashed form. To prevent rainbow tables from being usable in this way, most modern password systems use\" salt\" — an extra random string that gets appended to the password before hashing so the same password will potentially have many different hashes, and it becomes infeasible to recover it even with the acceleration offered by rainbow tables. An additional pun is that rivers contain fresh water, so there's no salt (the chemical kind) and the fish are therefore more vulnerable.\n\nThe comic dialogue itself starts the whole chain of puns off by using the phrase\"shooting fish in a barrel\", which is figuratively used to mean that the task is extremely easy, but here becomes clear that he is literally executing fish, without needing to be there in person. Also, Black Hat has previously talked about shooting\"lonely, angsty fish in a barrel.\"\n\nIt might also be a pun referencing Call of Duty, as the game's acronym is\"COD\" and Black Hat is seen shooting something on a computer with a\"Blam!\". In this sense,\"remote COD execution\" could refer to running Call of Duty on the fish hatchery's computer equipment remotely, though this would then not make this scenario particularly reliant upon anything fish-related, rendering the rest of the puns less explicable.\n\nfish is also the name of a UNIX shell. Shells are popular targets for computer hackers as they are capable of being used to run arbitrary commands if sufficient access is gained through them.","comic_index":2958},{"URL":"https:\/\/www.explainxkcd.com\/wiki\/index.php\/2959","Publish date":"July 15, 2024","Explanation":"Albert Einstein is famous for his theory of special relativity (which deals with the interactions between high speeds and the perceptions of time), and he developed this theory, in part, by imagining himself flying alongside a beam of light. Thought experiments such as this can reveal what appear to be fundamental principles of the universe that can revolutionize scientific understanding.\n\nIn this comic, Albert Einstein is depicted having an early version of this thought experiment. At this stage of theory development, it is less about breaking down the complex nature of relativity and more about how fun it would be to go really fast. So his thought experiment is currently just, so to speak, a flight of fantasy. (Although even Einstein's\"NYYOOOM\" sound of a car whizzing by is the sound of the Doppler effect, which alludes strongly to the relativistic Doppler effect and redshift.) Since this is early in his life, he is most likely sitting in the Swiss patent office he is so famous for working at, when he got his ground breaking ideas.\n\nIn a similar vein, the title text refers to one of the long-standing issues about Mercury: its orbit around the Sun doesn't quite match what Newtonian physics would predict. We now know that this is accounted for by general relativity, another of Einstein's notable theories (which relates how gravity, or the space-time curvature that we understand as gravity, influences time and space, including planetary orbits) that was further developed out from the framework of special relativity. Again, we find ourselves overhearing his thoughts before he reaches any insights that will start to explain this. Instead he is stuck at just'imagining' that Mercury is hot due to its proximity to the Sun, which isn't a particularly novel or useful conclusion, or close to what we would now recognize as Einstein's much-lauded theory.\n\nAt around the time of the comic's scenario, being only the first stages of Einstein's thoughts about Relativity, the issue of the Sun's heat was still considered a mystery. The Kelvin–Helmholtz mechanism was proposed as the cause of the Sun's heat but was later superseded by the more modern understanding of nuclear fusion. The Yarkovsky effect had also been previously described as how thermal effects may influence orbital dynamics; this is still useful to know about in the case of asteroids but is not considered a significant factor for Mercury. Neither of these things were ever the focus of Einstein's own studies, though in 1915 he showed that General Relativity could explain Mercury's orbital anomalies, and independent observations during a 1919 solar eclipse helped confirm the principles and make Einstein famous.\n\nAn older version of Einstein was previously drawn in 1206: Einstein and 1233: Relativity.","comic_index":2959},{"URL":"https:\/\/www.explainxkcd.com\/wiki\/index.php\/2960","Publish date":"July 17, 2024","Explanation":"This is a graph by Randall ranking how well he understands the function of certain human organs, compared to how much he understands metaphors using them.\n\nA number of organs (and other body parts) are used in common vernacular for metaphorical meaning. The English language is full of sayings like\"she had a lot of heart\",\"go with your gut\", and\"he hasn't got the stomach for it\". One might expect understanding an organ's role and its use in metaphor to be strongly correlated, since the metaphors generally work by drawing a parallel to biological function. However, since our understanding of biological functions has evolved dramatically over time, and metaphorical language does not always keep up, the correspondence is often much looser. To complicate matters, many such anatomical metaphors vary from culture to culture, even though the biological functions remain largely consistent. [ citation needed]\n\nThe pineal gland, located in the center of the brain, was described as the\"Seat of the Soul\" by the mind-body dualist René Descartes in the 17th century. If this was true, the metaphors that might be derived from it would be quite clear. It was only in the mid-20th century that its real neuroendocrine (hormone-producing) biological role was grasped. Thus, the real meaning of the metaphor\"the pineal gland of something\" is uncertain, as is its actual function for the layman. It was also described as a\"third eye\", as its regulation of the circadian rhythm used to be linked to light perception in the organ, and still is in Tuataras. It is also jokingly stated as still the location of the soul within discordianism.\n\nThe thymus, highlighted in the title text, plays an important role in the immune system. It is not commonly used in metaphors, [ citation needed] but is perhaps ripe for use in ones describing such things as resilience, indomitability, and adaptability to changing circumstance, were more people to know what it was.\n\n<table class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:auto\">\n<tr>\n<th> Organ <\/th>\n<th> Biological understanding <\/th>\n<th> Metaphor understanding <\/th>\n<th> Biological function <\/th>\n<th> Metaphor meaning(s) <\/th>\n<th> Comments\n<\/th><\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td> <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Appendix_(anatomy)\" title=\"wikipedia:Appendix (anatomy)\">Appendix<\/a> <\/td>\n<td> 3% <\/td>\n<td> 85% <\/td>\n<td> Maintaining gut flora, introducing pathogens to the immune system <\/td>\n<td> Uselessness; extraneousness <\/td>\n<td>  The appendix was long assumed to be vestigial with no useful function, and thus could be removed with minimal consequences.

CrowdStrike makes security software to protect computers from malware, ransomware and other cyberattacks. The software is sold to businesses and large enterprises like hospitals, airlines and retailers. CrowdStrike frequently releases updates to their software to handle new types of malware they know about. A faulty update for one of their software products, which was apparently released without adequate testing or quality assurance, caused computers with the software installed to crash (a Blue Screen of Death, given that it caused failures primarily in Microsoft Windows versions 10 and 11) very early on when booting up. This meant the computers could not be quickly or automatically fixed. Because many large businesses with large numbers of computers used CrowdStrike's software on at least some of their systems, or relied upon businesses that did, the resulting disruption was very widespread and very visible, preventing those businesses from operating and, in many cases, preventing their employees from working while their computers were affected. Even nominally unaffected systems (not having CrowdStrike\/an afflicted version of Windows installed) could find themselves indirectly, and perhaps only partially, unusable due to relying upon other systems that were afflicted.\n\nApparently, Cueball and Ponytail's company, or possibly a company providing a service their work depends on, uses CrowdStrike to secure their computers (although they may just be using it as an excuse to slack off, if their colleagues don't know any better). Without being able to work, they have found something more entertaining to do -- Cueball, riding a scooter and with a rope tied around his waist, is towing Ponytail, who is half-kneeling on a swiveling chair, around their office or neighborhood. Performing this activity is probably a bad idea. [ citation needed]\n\nAs the caption suggests, not everyone has the luxury of slacking off while their computers are broken. CrowdStrike engineers had to address the faulty update, and help the businesses using their software to fix their computers. And relevant employees at affected customers' IT departments had to work to mitigate the impacts, and to roll out the necessary fixes. In the event, CrowdStrike had released a patch for the software around six hours after it came to light, but this had to be manually applied to each affected device.\n\nThe title text refers to 303: Compiling, in which Cueball also found an alternative way to spend time at work when'forced' to step away from his computer, albeit for a less disruptive reason.

These major events resulted in Harris replacing Biden as one of the top two candidates for President in the 2024 election.\n\nThis comic features a three-way Venn diagram (which is also an Euler diagram). The three circles represent eligibility for US presidency, ability to do a good job as the US president, and love for Venn diagrams:\n\nPart of the humor arises from the contrast of putting on a level playing field three characteristics that range widely from the momentous to the quirky, as well as the implication that Randall and Harris are quite similar in all but one area: their fitness to serve as US President, per Randall's opinion. The diagram does not indicate anyone who Randall would include in the six other areas (categories) of the Venn diagram besides the two in which he listed himself and Harris.\n\nThe title text quotes Kamala Harris on her affection for Venn diagrams, and implies that the best way to target Randall with political ads is to mention how amazing Venn diagrams are.\n\nRandall seems to express support for a Democratic Presidential candidate every 8 years, including in a 2016 comic I'm With Her endorsing Hillary Clinton and in a 2008 blog post endorsing Barack Obama. In 2032 he will endorse Cyborg Joseph Biden Abraham Lincoln (and yes, the spiders are able to vote), followed by Cyborg 89890 in 2040, Gabriele Cirulli in 2048, and X Æ A-12 Musk in the 2056 United States of America and Mars (USAM) election.","comic_index":2962},{"URL":"https:\/\/www.explainxkcd.com\/wiki\/index.php\/2963","Publish date":"July 24, 2024","Explanation":"This is another comic in a series depicting confusion matrices, similar to 2813: What To Do, 2420: Appliances, and 1890: What to Bring.

As mentioned above, only the Scoville scale would normally see numbers this high (for example, an 18 on the Richter scale would vaporize the Earth). Allowing for some speculation, it's likely the three base numbers are multiplied, as with similar compound-unit calculations, to give the single combined measure (although some nominal types are treated as additive). This would be consistent with likely values of the earthquake, tornado, and chilli peppers:\n\n<ul><li> Richter: Since the building is still there it is not a 9 on the Richter scale, suggesting a maximum around 8. The fracturing of the earth suggests a minimum of 6.<\/li>\n<li> Fujita: Given the image, this is not a 5 on the tornado scale, suggesting a maximum around 4. The severe damage to the building suggests a minimum of 3.<\/li>\n<li> Scoville: This would then leave the rest for the Scoville scale. 55,000 divided by estimates of 8 and 3 would give around 1700 Scoville units, a normal value for poblano peppers (Scoville number between about 1000 and 2000). The other two numbers could also be smaller, requiring a higher Scoville rating to reach 55,000 through multiplication, but there are many hotter peppers to make up the difference, such as jalapeño peppers (2500 to 10,000 Scoville units) among others.<\/li><\/ul>\n\nIn the title text it is mentioned that buildings constructed from softer materials were damaged by chili pepper impacts [due] to the storm's high Richter-Fujita-Scoville-Mohs hardness rating. The Mohs scale is a scale for mineral hardness which ranges from 1 (e.g. talc) to 10 (diamond), with lower numbers being softer and higher numbers being harder. Chili peppers are strong in a spicy sense, but very soft on the Mohs scale, so if it was only the chilies that hit other buildings it would only be very soft material that would take any damage. Of course there would also be building material hitting nearby houses, thus they would do more damage than the chili, by an amount that would depend upon the relative hardness of the processing plant structure to that of other buildings. The former is frangible enough to have become dislodged from its structure, but may be just as brittle as it is ultimately abrasive, or is composed of thoroughly resilient pieces of material previously held in place by mortar or some other binding of insufficient adhesion or mechanical strength. From either point or failure (or both!), the wind-whipped cloud of debris might then indeed be able to scour more generally well-built structures nearby, even ones actually designed to withstand and absorb such winds\/earth movements in their own right.\n\nA number, where the hardness of the materials hitting nearby buildings was taken into consideration, could have been given, adding a fourth number to consider in the scale, but no such number is provided.\n\nSimilar comics:\n\n<ul><li> <a href=\"\/wiki\/index.php\/2950:_Situation\" title=\"2950: Situation\">2950: Situation<\/a> - several unlikely scenarios, all at once<\/li>\n<li> <a href=\"\/wiki\/index.php\/1531:_The_BDLPSWDKS_Effect\" title=\"1531: The BDLPSWDKS Effect\">1531: The BDLPSWDKS Effect<\/a> - also a hybrid multi-disciplinary amalgam of measurements<\/li>\n<li> <a href=\"\/wiki\/index.php\/1794:_Fire\" title=\"1794: Fire\">1794: Fire<\/a> - featuring a multiple-alarm fire in an alarm factory<\/li><\/ul>\n\nThe title text might be missing the word\"due,\" or it might not be a typo; both scenarios are possible, but the meaning changes.\n\nSince it's impossible to say which scenario is correct, here are the implications of both.\n\nThe sentence as written means that the chili peppers impacted the magnitude of the scale. In other words, buildings made of soft materials were damaged because the Richter-Fujita-Scoville-Mohs hardness rating was higher than it otherwise would have been as a result of the chili peppers. This suggests that spicier peppers are more likely to damage soft buildings.\n\nThe text has a somewhat awkward and unusual phrasing, if this was the intended meaning. If it was intended, Randall is presumably making a pun on the word impact, using it in an unusual way. Discussion about impacts from disasters usually talk about physical impacts, not impacts to abstract measurement systems, so the joke may be about this secondary kind of impact.\n\n\"Buildings constructed from softer materials were damaged by chili pepper impacts due to the storm's high Richter-Fujita-Scoville-Mohs hardness rating.\"\n\nThe sentence with\"due\" means that soft buildings were damaged by chili peppers, since the storm's hardness rating was high enough. This seems more straightforward: harder peppers successfully effacing soft building materials.","comic_index":2965},{"URL":"https:\/\/www.explainxkcd.com\/wiki\/index.php\/2966","Publish date":"July 31, 2024","Explanation":"The comic depicts various similarly formatted examination questions that might appear on test papers at various points in a student's potential academic career.

This is backwards from how most right-handed people feel most natural when stepping on a skateboard. In this comic, famed professional skateboarder Tony Hawk, who skates goofy-footed, has obtained a professorship in physics and is teaching about antimatter in particle physics, which has the opposite electrical charge of corresponding matter particles that will annihilate each other upon collision, releasing energy proportional to their combined mass. As Tony Hawk does not have a degree in physics, [ citation needed] teaching inaccurate or very non-standard lessons such as this one could be a likely pitfall of his gaining a professorship in real life. Hawk is also the subject of 296: Tony Hawk.\n\nUnlike other distributions of'handedness' in the natural world (chemical chirality, or the skewness of bimodal statistics describing asymmetries in nature called homochirality),'goofy-footed' skateboarders are about as common as those using standard footing. Thus the analogy indirectly raises the issue of baryon asymmetry, the observation that ordinary matter is very much more common than antimatter because there is so little evidence of annihilation throughout the universe. Baryon asymmetry is often thought to have resulted from fluctuations during cosmological inflation between 10 −33 and 10 −32 seconds after the Big Bang, although there are several other candidate explanations of varying falsifiability.\n\nThe title text describes Hawk as the first person to\"land a 900,\" meaning the successful completion of a skateboarding trick that involves two and a half rotations (nine hundred degrees, as 2.5 × 360° = 900°). In physics, spin is a quantum number describing subatomic particles (see 1862: Particle Properties), named in reference to the vaguely analogous but crucially distinct concept of angular momentum in classical physics. Obeying Fermi–Dirac statistics requires that the particles involved are fermions, which include all of the electrons, protons and neutrons that compose the entirety of everyone's body and electrochemical state. Fermions all have half-integer (i.e.,...–1½, –½, ½, 1½...) spin quantum numbers which do indeed include 2½, but only extremely rare particles have a spin of 5\/2. However, it's very important to remember that quantum mechanical spin is not rotation, but instead how quickly the corresponding particle changes state when rotated.\n\nWhile everyone (and almost everything we ordinarily interact with except light and cosmic rays) is composed entirely of fermions, any composite particle made of an even number of fermions, including entire atoms and their nuclei, are not fermions but bosons, which do not obey Fermi–Dirac statistics. Luckily, landing a 900 does not actually require obedience to Fermi–Dirac statistics because a skateboarder composed entirely of bosonic atoms would still have fermionic electrons in the orbitals of those atoms and thus would still obey the far more macroscopically fundamental and consequential Pauli exclusion principle. That principle gives atoms and molecules, which are almost entirely empty space, tangible presence and material form, allowing us to hold things, walk, make sound waves with our voices, employ any mechanical property of matter, and allowing sufficiently skilled skateboarders to land a 900.","comic_index":2967},{"URL":"https:\/\/www.explainxkcd.com\/wiki\/index.php\/2968","Publish date":"August 5, 2024","Explanation":"Cueball has been the leader of a university for the last five years. In a speech, he declares that his goal during those five years has been to make his university overtake the age of the oldest university in his state, which is obviously impossible. [ citation needed] The other university was then two years older than his own (215 years vs 213 years old). He states he has funded an intensive program to make the university five years older, or three years older than the rival university was. That would have happened anyway, whatever he had done (short of such gross mismanagement as to cause his university to cease operations), or if he'd done nothing at all.\n\nThe final line of Cueball's speech,\"Unfortunately, I have terrible news\", presumably precedes the announcement that the rival university has also aged 5 years and is therefore just as far ahead as they were before.\n\nUniversities often plan ambitious initiatives to boost prestige. However, true success often depends on factors outside administrative control, such as student quality, alumni achievements, faculty research, historical reputation, and external economic and social factors. While administrative efforts are important for operations and gradual improvements, a university's overall prestige cannot be engineered quickly through planning alone.\n\nIn the title text, Cueball's proposed\"roadmap for the next 10 years\" could mean more of the same ineffective efforts, perhaps merging his university into another institution that was founded before the rival university, or undermining the rival university so it ceases operation, probably by malicious means. A much more unlikely plan could involve placing the rival university in a spacecraft on a near-light speed journey, slowing its apparent age due to relativistic time dilation. Most likely, his plan is to continue doing the same thing as he'd done the last five years but making it sound like a new idea even though nothing will ultimately change.","comic_index":2968},{"URL":"https:\/\/www.explainxkcd.com\/wiki\/index.php\/2969","Publish date":"August 7, 2024","Explanation":"Randall observes that American Vice Presidents since the 1980s have almost all gone by short first names. It should be noted that all of the\"short\" first names in this strip, with the exception of John (F. Kennedy) are diminutives (or initials) of longer names, but all represent the names which the candidates preferred and publicly used. This comic was published one day after Kamala Harris (who replaced Biden as presidential candidate) chose Tim Walz as her running mate for the 2024 presidential election. Both the Republican and Democratic tickets are listed for 2024, since the 2024 election had not yet concluded when this comic was made. Either party winning would match the observation.\n\nIn the comic's caption, Randall amusingly describes this as an emerging\"political consensus.\"\n\nWhile not a\"political\" consensus per se, the observed phenomenon is a type of consensus — reflecting a multi-decade change in US societal norms — and is not simply a random coincidence.\n\n<ul><li> There has been a national US trend toward shorter names since the 1980s and 1990s, with a rise in the popularity of baby names like Ryan, Kyle, Amy and Lisa. (The trend has continued, with even shorter names like Ava, Mia and Max becoming more common in the 2000s and 2010s.) <\/li>\n<li> This has paralleled a trend in shorter business names, with companies like Dell, Cisco and eBay before the turn of the millennium and Google, Uber and Lyft after (cf. pre-1980 businesses like AT&amp;T, BNSF or 3M which had to convert their very long names into acronyms to adapt). Product naming also began to simplify in the late 20th century, driven by marketing strategies that favored brevity and memorability, exemplified by Apple's iconic \"iMac\" and \"iPhone\" products.<\/li>\n<li> All of these naming trends reflect a <i>general<\/i> societal trend toward minimalism and less formality, also seen with corporate logos, product design (Apple), clothing design (Gap), furniture design (IKEA) and web\/app design.<\/li><\/ul>\n\nThis societal shift may explain why many politicians with given names like Albert and Richard might have preferred to go by shorter, less formal sounding, more approachable names like Al and Dick, to match the zeitgeist.\n\nThat Vice Presidents have used shorter names than Presidents since the 1980s is an interesting coincidence (more discussion below). Most of the Presidents since the 1980s happened to have names (such as George, Barack and Kamala) that can't be easily shortened. And the exception, Donald Trump (which can be shortened to Don), did not become a politician until the nice age of 69, when he was already nationally famous using his full name.\n\nThe title text amusingly suggests (1) the existence of a ScrabbleTV News channel (named after the word game) staffed with (2) political pundits who (3) report Biden's decision to end his re-election campaign as being driven by orthographic (related to the writing of words) pressure to conform to the aforementioned political consensus. Having Joe Biden as President and Kamala Harris as VP violated this pattern, but elevating Harris to the presidency and selecting a short-named running mate restored it. Like Tim Walz, all of the final six candidates considered as Harris's running mate had short first names: Josh Shapiro, Mark Kelly, Andy Beshear, Roy Cooper and Pete Buttigieg.\n\n<ul><li> This could also be a subtle joke about political pundits tending to give confident, inaccurate hot-takes. (Biden's decision was driven, among other things, by worsening polling, rising concerns about his age, a poor debate performance against Trump and subsequent pressure from other leading Democrats.) <\/li><\/ul>\n\nThis is Randall's second recent comic about US politics and Kamala Harris, the first being 2962: President Venn Diagram which was published right after she rose to the top of the Democratic ticket.\n\nIt is interesting that, even ignoring the stricter definition of having less than four letters in their name, only four pairings have a Presidential given (or adopted) name that is shorter than the Vice-Presidential one, and just two further cases (one of these not involved in winning an election) have equal length names.\n\n<table class=\"wikitable\">\n<caption> Presidential and Vice-Presidential names, for the period within the comic, in chronological order.\n<\/caption>\n<tr>\n<th> Year <\/th>\n<th> President <\/th>\n<th> Vice-President\n<\/th><\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td> 1952<br\/>(also 1956) <\/td>\n<td> <b>Dwight<\/b> David \"Ike\"<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-ike_1-0\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ike-1\">[1]<\/a><\/sup> <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Dwight_D._Eisenhower\" title=\"wikipedia:Dwight D.

(See here regarding 1723: Meteorite Identification).\n\nIn the first panel of the comic, Cueball finds a meteorite on the ground, likely from the Perseids meteor shower. He then tries to throw it back into space, which is obviously impossible. However, the comic marks this action as wrong (with an X) not because it’s impossible, but for a different reason. The PSA in the next panel (marked as correct with a check mark) suggests that instead of throwing it, Cueball should contact an observatory and deliver the meteorite to them. There, astronomers like Ponytail can care for it, possibly releasing it back into space during the next launch.\n\nThis idea mixes up the concept of meteoroids with baby animals that have been separated from their parents and need rehabilitation—like baby birds that have fallen from their nests (though usually from trees rather than the sky). The advice for finding a wild animal, especially a baby one, is generally to leave it alone because its parents are likely nearby and taking care of it. If the animal is sick, injured, or orphaned, it's best to contact a wildlife rehabilitator who can properly care for it and return it to the wild. However, this advice does not apply to meteors. [ citation needed]\n\nIf you find a recently fallen meteorite or a fragment of one, avoid touching it, as it may be extremely cold. Though the meteor’s surface is heated by the atmosphere during its descent, the interior remains as cold as space, and the surface will rapidly cool if it hasn't already. The coldness depends on the meteorite’s size, fragmentation, and how long it has been on the ground—unless it was large enough to generate additional heat from the impact. Experts prefer you not handle meteorites directly, as this can contaminate the specimen, making it less valuable for scientific study. In rare cases, such as with more dangerous examples, the meteorite could even contaminate you!\n\nTechnically, Randall uses the term\"meteor\" incorrectly. A\"meteor\" refers to the streak of light seen when a meteoroid enters the atmosphere. If a piece survives and lands on the ground, it's called a\"meteorite\" (although some refer to it as magma). This might be intentional to fit the\"lost baby bird\" analogy, as, like baby birds (except for those from ground-nesting species), a true meteor should never be found on the ground.\n\nThe title text humorously suggests that handling the meteor for too long might result in forming a contact binary, which is when two space rocks stick together. While this term is also used for binary star systems, it’s unlikely that a person and a rock would form one. In rehabilitating young animals, preventing imprinting —where the animal forms a psychological attachment to its caregiver—is important because the animal needs to be able to survive in the wild without human help.","comic_index":2970},{"URL":"https:\/\/www.explainxkcd.com\/wiki\/index.php\/2971","Publish date":"August 12, 2024","Explanation":"This comic highlights the extreme rarity of witnessing multiple special events— auroras, great comets, total solar eclipses, and 17-year cicada emergences —all occurring simultaneously in the same location. It calculates that such an event would happen only once every 4.3 billion years, a time span comparable to the age of the Earth. The comic was posted shortly after some people reported seeing auroras in conjunction with the Perseids meteor shower. [1] Randall also includes a 50% chance of clear skies, which further reduces the odds of witnessing all events together. The comic exaggerates the difficulty of this happening, emphasizing that these conditions align less often than Earth's lifespan, suggesting such a celestial spectacle might only occur once before Earth becomes uninhabitable.\n\nThe calculation assumes that these events occur independently and that their probabilities remain constant over time, leading to the improbable result. However, this is a simplification, as factors like orbital mechanics and atmospheric conditions are not entirely random, whereas others, such as the amount of cloud cover and the existence of cicadas, may change unpredictably over time. Randall estimates that total solar eclipses occur once every 350 years at a given location, a value close to the 320 year interval for his hometown of Boston, Massachusetts, based on NASA's computations. Another problem is that the lunar orbit is slowly expanding, and thus total solar eclipses will cease to be possible at some point in the future.\n\nThe title text humorously suggests using 13-year cicadas instead of 17-year ones to improve the odds, reducing the interval to 3.29 billion years. This idea, along with the possibility of weather manipulation, reflects Randall's satirical take on humanity's desire to control or predict natural phenomena, even when the timescales involved are beyond human comprehension. Earth's oceans may evaporate in about a billion years [2], adding a layer of urgency and humor to the idea of witnessing this\"super-event\" before life on Earth ceases to exist.","comic_index":2971},{"URL":"https:\/\/www.explainxkcd.com\/wiki\/index.php\/2972","Publish date":"August 14, 2024","Explanation":"This comic explores the challenges of obtaining helium. Hairy is leading a company meeting with Megan, Cueball, and Hairbun, who are discussing the recurring problem of helium shortages, a real-world issue due to helium's limited availability on Earth. Helium is a non-renewable resource primarily extracted from natural gas deposits and its scarcity can affect industries such as medical imaging, semiconductor manufacturing, scientific research, and party balloon supplies. [1] See also 2766: Helium Reserve.\n\nHairbun suggests investigating the origin of helium. Cueball's research reveals that most helium in the universe came from Big Bang nucleosynthesis, which occurred shortly after the Big Bang when the first elements were formed. It appears to have overlooked the fact that 99% of the helium on Earth has been produced from the slow radioactive decay of the decay chains of naturally occurring uranium-238 and thorium-232 (which in turn came from r-process nucleosynthesis scattered from merging neutron stars; [2] see 2826: Gold) emitting alpha particles that are identical to temporarily ionized helium, with only the remaining one percent originating from the Big Bang.\n\nHairy assigns the team to figure out how to recreate Big Bang nucleosynthesis, which in real life is not actually possible for a contemporary business organization. [ citation needed] Nonetheless, the team somehow builds a machine capable of it. They are successful, likely obliterating themselves and at least all the closest galaxies in the process.\n\nThe final panels show the creation of a second Big Bang followed by the next 14 billion years of that new universe, culminating with the same characters in an identical meeting, presumably having arisen from the same series of post-Big Bang events as in the original universe. This suggests a cyclic universe in which events repeat themselves exactly (which chaos theory implies would be extremely unlikely. [ actual citation needed]) They are facing the same predicament: helium shortages have become a problem, and they once again need a more reliable source. The implication is that this is a recurring cycle, a religious\/philosophical concept called eternal return that occurs in many world religions (such as Hinduism's Cycle of Yugas of creation and destruction), but centered here on the helium needs of a unnamed, resourceful company.\n\nAnother possible interpretation is that the new Big Bang does not destroy the existing universe, but creates a new one connected in some way to the old, from which helium can be extracted. This new universe's inhabitants would eventually develop the same problem with a shortage of helium, causing them to create another new universe to get helium from it, ad infinitum.\n\nThe title text is a wordplay on the concepts of cosmic inflation and monetary inflation. In economics, monetary inflation is the rate at which the cost of goods and services increases over time (one can also think of this as the value of money falling). If the interest rate on a debt is less than inflation, then the relative cost of the debt decreases over time. Cosmic inflation is a theory in cosmology that describes the rapid expansion of the universe just after the Big Bang. The joke imagines the original company as having incurred a significant debt (perhaps as a result of the costs of building the Big Bang machine), which has now been inherited by its subsidiary. Somehow, thanks to the effect of cosmic inflation, this debt was diluted (perhaps physically across the ever-expanding vastness of space), reducing it to almost nothing.

By connecting the belt to different circumferences, the relative motion is geared up or down. If the belt passes around the circumference of one wheel and is connected around the hub of another, the latter will rotate significantly faster. In this case, the second wheel's circumference is in turn connected to a third wheel's hub, resulting in even greater rotational velocity. However, this setup is mechanically unsound and possibly dangerous, [ citation needed] as Ferris wheels are not intended to be connected in this way. As shown, the first wheel on the left is running at a normal speed, while the other two are rotating increasingly fast, leading to a potentially hazardous situation where passengers are flung around to various extents.\n\nFerris wheels can vary widely in size and speed of rotation, but for illustration, let us assume a diameter of about 200 feet (60 m) and a pretty sedate speed of around 10 minutes per full rotation. The apparent ratio between the connected wheels in the comic is approximately 12.5:1, meaning the motion is significantly sped up as it’s transferred. The second Ferris wheel, driven by the first, could spin at around 1.3 rpm, with passengers moving at 9 mph (14 km\/h), giving a more exciting ride, but not inherently dangerous. However, when this motion is further transferred to the third Ferris wheel, it could spin at a possible 16 rpm, with passengers traveling at over 110 mph (180 km\/h), subjecting them to around 8 Gs of force. Randall has previously explored the limits of the human body's tolerance for acceleration in What If # 116\"No Rules NASCAR\". Additionally, if a Ferris wheel span at 110 mph (180 km\/h) it would itself be just as dangerous even without any riders. However, since the motor for the first wheel would have been selected merely to drive one wheel, it's unlikely it would be able to power the other two wheels moving at these increased speeds — if it moved at all, all three would probably start to move quite slowly, with potential damage to the motor before any friction limitations and other mechanical failures kicked in.\n\nIn the caption Randall says that he was fired for this ill-advised modification, highlighting the impracticality and dangers of the idea. A cruise line also fired the respective narrator due to an unsound engineering proposal earlier in 2935: Ocean Loop.\n\nThe title text imagines the consequences of leaving the belt drive system in place but switching which wheel is powered. If the most extreme wheel (the third one on the right) is powered, the gearing would be reversed, making for a possibly pleasant and normal ride on the right-hand wheel, but rendering the experiences of the riders on the other two wheels far too slow for an enjoyable carnival ride. One revolution of the center wheel might take two hours and five minutes, while the left wheel would take around a little more than a day per revolution. This exaggerates the impracticality and unintended effects of using a belt drive system to link up Ferris wheels, illustrating how such an idea would lead to absurdly varied ride experiences.","comic_index":2973},{"URL":"https:\/\/www.explainxkcd.com\/wiki\/index.php\/2974","Publish date":"August 19, 2024","Explanation":"Calculus is a branch of mathematics which deals with continuously changing values. In order to demonstrate the application of this sort of math, introductory courses will commonly use physical examples to show how equations can be applied in real life. A common example of such a problem is to postulate a tank full of liquid, with a hole near the bottom, and ask the students to calculate how long it will take the tank to empty (generally assuming a cylindrical tank with the top at atmospheric pressure, leaking a low-viscosity fluid like water at a normal temperature flowing through a round hole.) The important variables are threefold: the radius of the tank, the height of the fluid above the hole, and the size of the hole.\n\nIn this case, the change in the liquid level is a function of the rate of flow through the hole, which is a function of the fluid pressure at the entrance to the hole (in accordance with Torricelli's law), and that pressure is a function of the remaining level of liquid. Accordingly, the amount of fluid left in the tank above the hole will follow a quadratic decay, a concept covered in calculus courses. A student with a mastery of foundational principles of calculus should be able to calculate the decline in tank level. More advanced versions of the problem might involve (A) one tank draining into a second, which drains to the ground, or (B) a sealed tank, in which air pressure at the top falls as the tank drains.\n\nAs mentioned, many STEM teachers like to use real-world examples, ideally physical demonstrations, to make abstract concepts more memorable for their students. A teacher might fill a jug with water, open a hole in the side, and invite students to compare the observed rate of draining to their calculations. This comic suggests that Miss Lenhart has taken this idea to extremes, having entered an industrial site and drilled a hole into a large, liquid-filled vat. One assumes that her class is either watching from afar, or that the leak is being somehow filmed.\n\nThe conversation between the employees in hardhats implies that there's a rash of calculus teachers conducting similar demonstrations, to the point that the primary job of the head of security is to prevent this pedagogically-motivated destruction. In real life, this vandalism would be serious, with safety risks from damaged vats, pressurized liquid, or hazardous contents (note the hazard warning (⚠) on the tank).\n\nThe title text jokingly alludes to the fact that by maintaining a constant pressure at the level of the leak, the rate of flow would also become constant, and the decline in level would therefore become linear, greatly simplifying the problem and eliminating the need for calculus. This easier version of the problem would presumably deter calculus teachers from using it as a demonstration — though it might attract similarly adventurous algebra teachers.\n\nObservation of the comic suggests the following assumptions:\n\n<ul><li> Tank height above hole: ~20 feet<\/li>\n<li> Tank radius: ~6 feet<\/li>\n<li> Type of drill bit: Normal twist drill bit (not a hole saw)<\/li>\n<li> Size of drill bit: 1 inch (largest commonly available twist drill bit)<\/li>\n<li> Goal of Miss Lenhart: To demonstrate quadratic decay to her students<\/li><\/ul>\n\nWith a tank that is 20 feet high, has a 6-foot radius, and a 1-inch diameter drill hole, it would take approximately 21.5 hours for the tank to empty completely — too long for a suitable class demonstration — though maybe filmed as a time-lapse video? — and nonetheless likely to be fixed by nearby workers who notice the leak.\n\nTo drain the tank in 36 minutes would take a 6-inch diameter hole.\n\nThus there's an apparent mismatch between the drill bit size, gushing liquid stream, and practicality of this real-world demonstration. The viscosity & density of the liquid is also an unknown factor; for ease of calculation, calculus problems tend to assume that the liquid is either ordinary water (which, by definition, has a density of 1.00* (1 kg\/liter (8.35 lbs\/gallon)) and a viscosity of 1.001 millipascal seconds) or a mixture mostly composed of water (depending on what exactly else it contains, such as dissolved solids or just other\n\n* at 20°C (68°F) & sea-level air pressure\n\nOne explanation is that she was able to drill a couple dozen approx. 1-inch holes in a short time, while toxic liquid is gushing out, but the drill doesn't appear to be dripping wet.\n\nBut the most likely explanation to all this is that Randall didn't think through the drill and drill bit size in relation to the apparent hole size, leaving it only to nitpicky editors of a comic explainer website to even notice and care.\n\nOr, the tank simply is not full at the moment the teacher drills the hole.","comic_index":2974},{"URL":"https:\/\/www.explainxkcd.com\/wiki\/index.php\/2975","Publish date":"August 21, 2024","Explanation":"An element is a basic atomic building block of the physical world. Ancient civilizations believed in a small number of broad elements. The most famous are the classical (Hellenistic) elements of earth, fire, air, water, and sometimes a fifth element such as\"void\",\"ether\", or\"quintessence\". The Chinese wuxing system was a bit different, dropping air and adding elements for wood and metal. Such elemental theories fell out of favor as alchemists and later scientists began to discover what we now recognize as the atomic model, and today 118 elements are recognized and organized into the Periodic Table of Elements.\n\nHere, Randall has taken a modern periodic table and merged and color-coded the modern elements to represent the four classical elements, leaving only the edges and boundaries between dissimilar regions. Gaseous elements such as hydrogen are colored light blue for\"air\". Bromine and mercury, the two elements that remain liquid at room temperature and pressure, are colored dark blue for\"water\". Radioactive elements along the bottom of the table whose isotopes have only extremely short half-lives are red for\"fire\", with the rest of the chart filled in brown for\"earth\". The\"earth\" region includes many elements which are radioactive but have isotopes whose half-lives are greater than 1 day. (All elements also have radioactive isotopes with much shorter half-lives, but most of the universe's supply of any given element will tend to be its longest-lived isotope, since others rapidly decay.)\n\nThe title text says that mercury should be classified as\"wet earth\". While it's a liquid, it has a very high surface tension so even large drops will stick together and may seem almost like a gel. Additionally, as evidenced by a very trustworthy source [1], mercury is functionally a solid for many fluid purposes, including boating.\n\n<table class=\"wikitable\">\n<tr>\n<th scope=\"col\"> Section in Randall’s Table\n<\/th>\n<th scope=\"col\"> Symbol\n<\/th>\n<th scope=\"col\"> Periodic table groups\n<\/th>\n<th scope=\"col\"> Elements contained\n<\/th>\n<th scope=\"col\"> Explanation\n<\/th><\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td> Air <\/td>\n<td> A <\/td>\n<td> All noble gases and most reactive nonmetals <\/td>\n<td> Hydrogen, Helium, Nitrogen, Oxygen, Fluorine, Neon, Chlorine, Argon, Krypton, Xenon, Radon <\/td>\n<td> These elements are a gas at room temperature, so they are grouped into \"air\".\n<\/td><\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td> Water <\/td>\n<td> W <\/td>\n<td> One metal and one nonmetal <\/td>\n<td> Bromine, Mercury <\/td>\n<td> These elements are liquid at room temperature, so they are grouped into “water”.\n<\/td><\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td> Fire <\/td>\n<td> F <\/td>\n<td> One alkali metal and many synthetic metals <\/td>\n<td> Astatine, Francium, Nobelium, Lawrencium, Rutherfordium, Dubnium, Seaborgium, Bohrium, Hassium, Meitnerium, Darmstadtium, Roentgenium, Copernicium, Nihonium, Flerovium, Moscovium, Livermorium, Tennessine, Oganesson <\/td>\n<td> These are all highly radioactive metals (with perhaps an exception for astatine and oganesson, which may be metalloids or nonmetals) with the most stable isotope having a half-life less than one day and a tendency to violently decompose, hence they are classified as \"fire\".

Normally, the travel itself goes off without a hitch, with the usual threats to the time traveler being what happens at some point after they arrive at their destination. More rarely, a time traveler might immediately encounter some hazard because of where their time travel method has deposited them.\n\nThis comic takes the latter situation to the extreme, observing different causes of death for potential time travelers through the ages based on the geologic evolution of Earth from its formation over 4 billion years ago to the present; see detailed explanation in the table. The chart shows only the most likely cause for a given period of time, although the title text reveals that there may always be others possible.\n\nThe title text suggests that an alternative fate within the\"eaten by fish\" era is the exact opposite - eating something hazardous.

First, Cueball presents an analysis of an existing theory, testing to see if it holds up under unusual circumstances. Second, Blondie presents a new theory; to prove that it has merit, it is tested on\"standard\" circumstances, presumably older data that the existing theories have already been tested on. As Blondie's data graph looks similar in form to Cueball's, it is possible that they are approaching the same field from two different directions.\n\nThe punchline is a disheveled Hairy presenting the third kind of research: not a theory, but a survey that collects the data to test theories on. Rather than sit around their laboratory crunching numbers, Hairy has gotten deep in the weeds — literally, judging by the leaves stuck to their body — to somehow map out\"every tree.\" How far their survey of\"every tree\" reaches isn't clear but it's implied to be a massive area such as most of a country, continent or even the world (though the appearance of the graph doesn't have any obvious relationship to any global projection), and they're raising their arms in exhausted triumph over the fact that they're finally finished.\n\nThe comic thus presents a message about science: while it is perceived to be a high-minded affair with lots of very smart people performing calculations well over most people's heads, it still relies on getting down and dirty — again, literally in Hairy's case — with the rather basic challenges of measuring what the problems are to begin with. Some scientific papers are simply descriptions of measured phenomena.\n\nThe title text brings everything together by testing theories on the tree map (this is similar to Cueball's approach), with suspicious results. There can be multiple interpretations of these results: the\"map of every tree\" was manipulated or simply inaccurate, someone is messing with trees on a global level or the tree survey methods and\/or mapping techniques are questionable. This could also be a reference to the discovery of General and Special relativity, which sprouted from the fact that the\"standard theory\" at the time, Newtonian gravity, was unable to account for certain observed phenomena, such as the orbit of Mercury.\n\nFor example, the ΛCDM standard model of cosmology could be 1) supported or challenged by new empirical data on the distribution of galaxies, new simulations or a mathematical thought experiment based on that model 2) challenged by a new model that is better at explaining some oddities of the model, such as dark energy 3) complemented with a survey of the timeline of everything in the universe:-)\n\nIn this case the fourth kind of researcher would apply the cosmological standard model to the map of everything and find something suspicious.\n\nRandall has previously created a similar type of comic in 2529: Unsolved Math Problems.","comic_index":2977},{"URL":"https:\/\/www.explainxkcd.com\/wiki\/index.php\/2978","Publish date":"August 28, 2024","Explanation":"This comic is referencing the Boeing Starliner, which launched for its Crewed Flight Test on June 5th, 2024. The mission to the International Space Station was originally scheduled for only eight days, but as of the comic’s release, August 28, 2024, the astronauts Butch Wilmore and Sunita Williams are still\"stranded\" on the ISS, not expected to return to Earth until February 2025.\n\nThe comic points out that being stranded is a matter of perspective and circumstances; people on Earth could equally be considered\"stranded\", unable to get off the planet. Many science fiction stories deal with some sort of rush to evacuate the Earth, though there's usually a reason why they would wish to leave, a reason that's notably absent in the comic. Moreover, the proposed solution of one rocket would not be able to bring all 8 billion people on Earth to space. [1]\n\nThe comic is also referencing the fact that during press conferences, NASA has stressed that the Starliner astronauts are not actually stranded, because there are procedures for emergency returns to Earth. However, the current circumstances are not dire enough to warrant this emergency procedure.\n\nThe title text references commentators saying that at least the Starliner crew aren't alone up there, as there are currently nine people aboard the ISS, but flips it around to be about the (8 billion) people on Earth. Another funny take on the title text would be that in the turbulent times the fact that one is\"stranded\" like this might even be a benefit. The 8 billion people are also not alone in the sense there are numerous other species on Earth.\n\nA comic with a similar premise is 2403: Wrapping Paper.","comic_index":2978},{"URL":"https:\/\/www.explainxkcd.com\/wiki\/index.php\/2979","Publish date":"August 30, 2024","Explanation":"The comic shows Megan and Cueball being alerted by a'Sky Alarm' that a'cool space thing' is happening. The alarm is triggered when a relatively interesting astronomical event occurs, for example, the Perseid meteor shower and blue supermoon that happened recently. Randall remarks in the caption how he wants this device and wishes it existed. Cueball and Megan (and by extension Randall) feel that they regularly miss events they'd like to see, and such a device would help prevent this.\n\nThe title text further specifies that he would want it to activate even for more common sky-related spectacles, such as interesting clouds and nice sunsets (which still can be very beautiful). In short, it would help its owner to not miss interesting outdoor sights.\n\nMost recently before this comic, Randall referred to cool sky phenomena in 2971: Celestial Event. Quite a few such references preceded this (such as the aforementioned Perseid meteor shower), so they may have been on Randall's mind.","comic_index":2979},{"URL":"https:\/\/www.explainxkcd.com\/wiki\/index.php\/2980","Publish date":"September 2, 2024","Explanation":"The comic shows Megan talking to Black Hat, mentioning the common myth that there's a lava lake in the crater of every volcano. She points out that there are really only around five lava-filled volcano craters in the world right now.\n\nIn true Black Hat fashion, he responds to this by creating a new lava lake on a nearby golf course. Given that Megan was still waiting when Black Hat came back, the attention span of most people is shorter than the time it takes lava lakes to form and that sane people do not build golf courses directly over active volcanoes, [ actual citation needed] Black Hat would've needed to dig at least 8 kilometers of earth within a very short timespan. Since this action was prompted by Megan's remark, Black Hat likely did not build or move anything capable of making a lava lake to the golf course beforehand.\n\nThe title text mentions that golf balls will float on lava, making recovering them from hazards easier (man-made obstacles such as sand or water, with sinking in the latter being the more obvious hazard to change). The density of a normal golf ball is about 1.13 grams per cubic centimeter, which is significantly less than the 2.4 ~ 2.9 grams per cubic centimeter of lava. It would be very easy to retrieve golf balls from lava because of this, if it were not for the fact that lava is hot. [ citation needed] Lava is around 800 °C, while most golf balls are made of materials that ignite at 400-500 °C, and it could also be somewhat awkward for any hand that goes to retrieve it. Not to mention that the interaction of lava with solids at STP tends to be violent. It would presumably also be extremely difficult to wipe lava from the surface of a golf ball, both while the lava is fresh and then changing to different challenges as it cools. Attempts to retrieve golf balls from lava would be profoundly dangerous, and have a vanishingly small probability of success.\n\nThese may be the 5 volcano lakes that the comic references ( source):\n\n<ul><li> <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Erta_Ale\" title=\"wikipedia:Erta Ale\">Erta Ale<\/a> in Ethiopia<\/li>\n<li> <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Mount_Erebus\" title=\"wikipedia:Mount Erebus\">Mount Erebus<\/a> on Ross Island, Antarctica<\/li>\n<li> Kīlauea <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Halema%CA%BBuma%CA%BBu\" title=\"wikipedia:Halemaʻumaʻu\">Halemaʻumaʻu<\/a> on Hawaiʻi (Big Island) [no active lake in September 2024]<\/li>\n<li> <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Mount_Nyiragongo\" title=\"wikipedia:Mount Nyiragongo\">Nyiragongo<\/a> in the Democratic Republic of the Congo<\/li>\n<li> <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Mount_Michael\" title=\"wikipedia:Mount Michael\">Mount Michael<\/a> on Saunders Island, South Sandwich Islands<\/li><\/ul>","comic_index":2980},{"URL":"https:\/\/www.explainxkcd.com\/wiki\/index.php\/2981","Publish date":"September 4, 2024","Explanation":"The slingshot (in this comic, styled\"Regular Slingshot\") is primarily refering to the hand-held device used for accelerating small projectiles, such as stones or steel balls. The\"forked stick and elastic\" contraption (known as a catapult, in the UK) acts by a pull-back-and-release action, and has become associated with youthful recklessness (or an outright tendency towards vandalism), but is also the basis of manufactured sport\/hunting devices as well as all of the more organic child-made contraptions.\n\nThe gravitational slingshot, or gravity assist, is not a device but a term used to describe how gravity can significantly alter the path of an object in space, such as a spacecraft or an asteroid. A gravitational slingshot generally involves a small object passing by a much more massive object, which turns the smaller object's trajectory, trading momentum and kinetic energy between the two bodies. The smaller object can undergo a large change in velocity,\"paid for\" (in the sense of conserving the momentum and energy of the system) with a negligible change in the velocity of the more massive body.\n\nThis comic humorously compares the two, in tabular format.\n\n<table class=\"wikitable\">\n<tr>\n<th>\n<\/th>\n<th> Regular slingshot\n<\/th>\n<th> Gravitational slingshot\n<\/th><\/tr>\n<tr>\n<th> Used for hunting\n<\/th>\n<td> ✓\n<\/td>\n<td> X\n<\/td><\/tr>\n<tr>\n<th> Used for sport shooting\n<\/th>\n<td> ✓\n<\/td>\n<td> X\n<\/td><\/tr>\n<tr>\n<th> Used for spacecraft propulsion\n<\/th>\n<td> X\n<\/td>\n<td> ✓\n<\/td><\/tr>\n<tr>\n<th> Large online enthusiast community\n<\/th>\n<td> ✓\n<\/td>\n<td> ✓\n<\/td><\/tr>\n<tr>\n<th> May have caused dinosaur extinction\n<\/th>\n<td> Probably not\n<\/td>\n<td> Maybe\n<\/td><\/tr>\n<tr>\n<th> Used by Dennis the Menace to terrorize Mr. Wilson\n<\/th>\n<td> ✓\n<\/td>\n<td> Not yet, but I'm pitching a reboot\n<\/td><\/tr><\/table>\n\nThe first four categories accurately reflect reality. As a hunting tool (and as an offensive weapon), recent designs have been claimed to propel a projectile with more force than.22 and.38 caliber pistols. Consequently, several communities have prohibited the possession of such slingshots, which may be called\"wrist rockets\". The state of Massachusetts, where cartoonist Randall resides, is one of those communities. Gravitational slingshots would be inefficient and overkill for such purposes, as well as being difficult to achieve sufficient accuracy and specificity.\n\nConversely, gravitational slingshots are a useful way to change the velocity of a spacecraft without having to use large amounts of fuel, whereas building a regular slingshot capable of propelling a spacecraft is likely to be impractical - not to mention the destructive\/fatal consequences, to vehicle and cargo, of near-instantaneous acceleration to useful speeds, such as the Mach 33 required for an object at sea level to escape Earth's gravity, especially when there's an atmosphere present.\n\nBoth types of slingshot excite interest among many people who may form online communities to discuss them, but for quite different reasons, and the size of overlap between these communities is uncertain.\n\nThe fifth category ventures into the absurd, at least with respect to\"regular\" slingshots, which did not exist (so far as we know) at the time of the Cretaceous-Tertiary extinction event. (Humans, which invented them, did not exist at that time. Use of slingshots would therefore require some other contemporaneous intelligent species to have invented them, or some kind of time travel.) However, it is likely that the event resulted from the impact of a space-rock that was perturbed into an Earth-crossing orbit by a planet such as Jupiter, given at least a minor gravitational slingshot on its way to eventually crashing into the Earth.\n\nThe sixth category references the long-running comic and cartoon character Dennis the Menace (USA), in which the titular character unintentionally harasses neighbor Mr. Wilson with (regular) slingshots and other devices and behaviors. In Randall's projected reboot of the franchise, which is elaborated on in the title text, Dennis trades his regular slingshot for a gravitational slingshot. By miscalibrating his ammunition, or the force of his slingshot, he turns a demonstration (\"a nice comet\") into a destructive event (the loss of Wilson's dinosaur garden). The reference is to the relative size and velocity of the space objects responsible for, respectively, comets and\"meteors\" versus asteroid impacts.\n\nThis comic is probably inspired by the recently released movie Slingshot.\n\nThis is very similar to 2844: Black Holes vs Regular Holes.","comic_index":2981},{"URL":"https:\/\/www.explainxkcd.com\/wiki\/index.php\/2982","Publish date":"September 6, 2024","Explanation":"This comic seems to be a diagram of how well water is purified, a common set of procedures done to make said water safe to drink.

This creates a very hot and humid atmosphere, making efficient heat transfer with all contents and inactivating all biological entities through this heat.

The advantage of this method compared to dry heat (aka putting things in a 150°C-180°C oven until they are sterile) is that most lab plastics survive a passage at 120°C without melting.

Even if the well water is only a small portion of the faucet water, its presence has now made the now incredibly pure water impure. This act of putting well water into the faucet after treating it may be a riff on the cultural interest in \"spring water\" or \"pure glacial water\" that is said to have additional minerals or beneficial properties but is oftentimes not meaningfully distinct from properly treated tap water. \"Local minerals and probiotics added\" may be a reference to Coke's \"Dasani\" brand drinking water, which is purified by reverse osmosis, and then has a package of minerals added to create the flavor (pure water's actual lack of flavor can be perceived as an unpleasantly 'flat' flavor).\n<p>In addition, drinking only <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Tonicity\" title=\"wikipedia:Tonicity\">extremely hypotonic<\/a> liquid intake can induce the body to expel more water than it took in (taking with it some essential minerals that are not being replaced) to try to maintain equilibrium of concentrations. This effect is not directly dangerous, but could exacerbate other bodily deficiencies in the long term and have the issues of greater than necessary liquid throughput than with 'normal' drinking water. The tendency for <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Sports_drink#Categories\" title=\"wikipedia:Sports drink\">many 'sports' or 'health' drinks<\/a> to hype the term 'isotonic' is based upon the idea that an ideal concentration of solutes can be added, in-between the opposing problems of having either too many <i>or<\/i> too few 'impurities'. The process does not include adding untreated (and probably also untested\/unquantified) ground water, which could carry pathogenic organisms and chemicals, and appears to have no mechanism for ensuring what <i>might<\/i> be an acceptable level of re-blending for the circumstances.\n<\/p><p>Alternatively, it may be that the level of purity achieved by this setup is so overkill, and the cost per liter processed so high, that it's simply more efficient to treat just enough of the water to dilute the rest of the water to acceptable levels of contaminants. For example, it's common to use a partial bypass to supply water to the shower, since shower water does not need to be potable. Also, some well water systems are clean enough to not need any treatment at all and can be used straight from the well, and some water systems are only slightly high in a single chemical contaminant that can be addressed by blending the water, either with treated water or another source (treated or untreated). Perhaps the treatment process led to enough radioactivity that blending with the original source was required to address radiological contamination (either gross alpha radiation or specific radionuclides).\n<\/p>\n<\/td><\/tr><\/table>\n\nThe title text briefly covers the cost implications of the components. Various'real' filter elements will have material or energy costs or both, in operation or to replenish their effectiveness, and the high energy input needed to disassociate hadrons into raw quark–gluon plasma (at bulk levels) would seem to require the most in terms of running the equipment. But it is pointed out that to ensure enough cosmic rays reach that particular phase of sterilization, there would have to be a pipe (not shown) leading out to the edge of the atmosphere to optimistically carry down such particles (due to also containing no air, i.e., keeping it out to negate the normal shielding and dissipating effect of the atmosphere on cosmic rays). However, this pipe would not only be a flight hazard, but also to ensure that no air molecules get in, the pipe would have to be similar to a space elevator, which would wreak a lot of havoc on LEO and MEO.\nWhether a one-off cost or needing regular replacement, the setting up of such a tubular structure (a vertical air-proof pipe perhaps somewhere between 100 and 10000 kilometers high) would be technically challenging and has not ever been actually accomplished. The conditions for a quark–gluon plasma, albeit in limited quantities, at least have been fulfilled at CERN, with its 27 kilometer airless pipe that goes round within a vast circular tunnel.","comic_index":2982},{"URL":"https:\/\/www.explainxkcd.com\/wiki\/index.php\/2983","Publish date":"September 9, 2024","Explanation":"A caster, also spelled castor, is a small unpowered wheel, usually attached to a swiveling base. They are typically found on carts and office chairs to make them easy to move, and may be placed on heavy appliances to facilitate movement.\n\nRandall has proposed a variant of the skateboard with only one caster on the bottom, the titular\"monocaster\", and devoted most of the comic to a perceptual map showing the variety of wheeled vehicles. Market strategists and investors use such diagrams as a simple way of representing important differences between products or companies, but where a consumer might be more concerned with features like speed, cost, ease of use, or carrying capacity, this map focuses on the number of wheels (horizontal axis) and the diameter of those wheels (vertical axis).\n\nEach axis uses a logarithmic scale, which is convenient for making the map look more evenly filled but also visually exaggerates the size of the\"key gap\" that the monocaster is filling, which can be described as\"vehicle with a single wheel smaller than 25 cm\". The nearest competitors appear to be a two-wheel skateboard sometimes called a caster board (wheel diameter under 8 cm) and a single-wheel self-balancing board resembling a Onewheel (diameter around 25 cm). The Onewheel is sometimes described as a monowheel (though these are traditionally larger like the\"1920s monowheel\" on the upper left). Randall appears to have combined these two names to create the monocaster. This gives up several of the competitors' features - the caster board's two wheels provide enough stability to propel the vehicle manually, while the Onewheel's single wheel is wide (assisting with sideways balance) and powered by a self-balancing mechanism.\n\nThe result resembles a\"Sphere-and-ring\" balance board, or other types, though these provide limited locomotion potential. The joke depends on the caster's obvious impracticality in this role: the hole in the market was open for a reason. The obvious drawback to any single-wheeled vehicle is that it's difficult to balance: the rider has to avoid falling forward or backward, as well as to either side. This is a major reason why one-wheeled vehicles are uncommon to begin with, but those vehicles which do exist compensate by using relatively large wheels, driven either by human power or a motor, which creates rotational inertia and allows the rider to balance simply by leaning forward.\n\nA single, small, undriven wheel eliminates these balancing forces, meaning that the user would essentially need to balance on a single point. Also, most casters swivel, meaning that the balance point would move around under the rider's feet and make it even more difficult to balance. In addition, there's no apparent means of propulsion, which means the only way to move forward would be to either roll exclusively downhill, or use one foot to push off the ground. Either strategy would make retaining balance almost impossible.\n\nMultiple-wheeled vehicles greatly reduce the issue of balance simply by having multiple points of contact with the ground. The size of the wheels varies greatly; small, rigid wheels are generally suitable only for flat, smooth, rigid surfaces at relatively slow speeds, while vehicles expected to handle high speeds and varying road (and off-road) conditions will necessarily have larger wheels.\n\nThe\"monocaster\" design offers no advantages and would be nearly unrideable, making it obvious why such a vehicle has never been seriously proposed.\n\nThe title text extends the joke by listing the disadvantages mentioned above, but not providing a rebuttal. Instead it only attempts an emotional appeal by saying that the competitors are being mean and by commenting that Randall believed they were friends.\n\n\n\n<table class=\"wikitable\">\n<tr>\n<th scope=\"col\"> Vehicle\n<\/th>\n<th scope=\"“col”\"> Number of wheels\n<\/th>\n<th scope=\"“col”\"> Wheel Diameter\n<\/th>\n<th scope=\"col\"> Explanation\n<\/th><\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td> 1920s Monowheel <\/td>\n<td> 1 <\/td>\n<td> 3 meters <\/td>\n<td>  A monowheel is a vehicle in which the rider sits inside a single, large, hollow wheel.

Cars are more expensive than most options on the chart due to their higher cost, the use of fuel and maintenance requiring specialized knowledge (and sometimes replacement parts), they make up for this with their speed, access to (at least in most of the world) an extensive system of roads and refueling stations, the ability to move a number of people and goods (how much depends on the exact type of car and how much of either the car is already carrying), and the comfort of being in what is almost always an enclosed and air conditioned compartment. Because of the potential danger of an object of a car's size and speed, drivers are required to perform a test of their ability to both control the vehicle and be aware of other traffic to obtain a license to drive one.

This allows the truck to switch trailers and move a different cargo without having to unload the trailer. The name in brackets that was used here (articulated lorry) is a name most commonly used in British English (or \"artic\", for short), with articulation meaning that the truck can swivel at the point where the truck connects to the trailer. This allows for the truck to make much tighter turns than if it were one long vehicle, which is another advantage of this configuration, with typically more stability than with a <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Drawbar_(haulage)\" title=\"wikipedia:Drawbar (haulage)\">drawbar<\/a> attachment. Trucks are designed to haul cargo for long distances, with the cargo in question being either too heavy or too large to carry with a smaller hopper, tanker, hard-\/soft-sided container or flatbed placed entirely upon a single truck chassis. They are driven either by drivers employed by a transport company, or by self-employed individuals who haul cargo for a living. A specialized license is required to drive one, and because of their size (even without a trailer), trucks have more limitations on where they can drive and park than normal cars. Like cars, trucks are a source of leisure, but because of the higher cost to purchase, maintain and drive them, they are more often enjoyed for their aesthetics rather than actually driving them for leisure. There are events like races for trucks, and trucks can be given elaborate paint jobs to have them stand out.\n<p>The number of wheels is for both the <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Tractor_unit#Axles\" title=\"wikipedia:Tractor unit\">truck<\/a> and a <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Semi-trailer#Types\" title=\"wikipedia:Semi-trailer\">trailer<\/a>, which can each differ vastly between vehicle configurations.  The truck in the comic has five <i>obvious<\/i> axle-sets (thus at least ten actual wheels): a single pair of front wheels, two pairs of trailer-bearing rear wheels and two pairs of wheels on the trailer itself. The drawing of the truck actually spans the axis range of three wheels (unlikely to be true, and the minimum for a tractor-trailer would normally be six) all the way up to 16, so it's not entirely clear which number (≥10) Randall intends this one to portray. Most of the other illustrations are roughly centered over the relevant number of wheels, but applying this to the truck implies six wheels, which is clearly wrong as illustrated.\n<\/p>\n<\/td><\/tr><\/table>\n\n(*) It seems that Randall has made some mistakes in regards to the wheel sizes, especially in the centimeter range of the diagram.

It could possibly be related to the recently discovered asteroid 2024 MK, which made a close approach to Earth on June 29, 2024, but it could be any of the Sentry Objects of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory's Center for Near Earth Object Studies [1].\n\nBlondie mentions that according to the astronomers, the asteroid only has'a one-in-6000 chance of\"doing something cool\",' meaning that there is only a small chance that the asteroid will have a direct impact on Earth's surroundings. What is described as\"something cool\" would presumably be that the asteroid hits or almost hits the Earth or the Moon. She then states that further observations have shown that this will not happen and the asteroid will just be yet another boring dot in the sky.\n\nThe joke is that most people are afraid that a near-Earth asteroid would actually hit, and hope to hear that it will not. If the asteroid in this comic gets close enough that it will actually be a visible dot, then given the normal sizes of near-Earth asteroids, it would indeed be very close to Earth. Many people interested in the night sky would find it interesting to see an asteroid with their naked eye.\n\nThe title text may refer to another asteroid that gets even closer than the one depicted, because this one should come closer than the Moon according to calculations (presumably by the astronomers). However, this asteroid will not hit the Moon even though it gets close, so the astronomers ask,\"What's the point?\". The comic is mute on the question whether the asteroid will hit the Earth, although this is generally very unlikely even for an asteroid passing closer than the Moon.

However, in the title text Randall believes that it COULD be an actual meteor impact site with enough dedication: he wants to redirect an asteroid into Hudson Bay, which is a bad idea [ citation needed]. There is no efficient way to artificially direct asteroids towards Earth, let alone ones large enough to make the appropriate size hole. The Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) slightly changed the orbit of one asteroid around another by slamming a spacecraft into the asteroid; doing any more substantial redirection would require applying a great deal of impulse to an asteroid, which has never been done. Moreover, the precision required would be a massive obstacle: a small variance in timing or angle would make the asteroid hit Earth in the wrong manner, at the very least creating an improperly matched hole (for size and shape), with the most likely outcome being to miss the original feature entirely. There is also the potential to slam into nearby populated areas, but some historic circular features are themselves populated so would suffer directly in the case of a perfect impact. Attempting to do so would be costly and potentially cause massive devastation.\n\nThis idea of directing an asteroid to directly impact the Earth is on some level an inversion of disaster movies like Armageddon, where an asteroid is landed on to destroy or deflect it; Armageddon was mentioned in 1740: Rosetta and 2729: Planet Killer Comet Margarita.","comic_index":2985},{"URL":"https:\/\/www.explainxkcd.com\/wiki\/index.php\/2986","Publish date":"September 17, 2024","Explanation":"Randall uses this pie chart to show that more than 95% of scientific topics are actually unknown to the general public, and he has listed three topics within the larger fields of cosmology, microbiology, and entomology as examples of obscure but consequential areas of research:\n\n<ul><li> <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Dark_energy\" title=\"wikipedia:Dark energy\">\"Dark energy\"<\/a> is the term used for the unknown cause of the <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Accelerating_expansion_of_the_universe\" title=\"wikipedia:Accelerating expansion of the universe\">accelerating expansion of the universe<\/a>.

Traditionally the name\" surfing\" refers to riding a surfboard that is itself floating on the ocean waves as they crash into shore, but in colloquial English it is possible to\"surf\" other things such as a crowd of people, the floor of a moving bus, a subway car, or the Internet.\n\nIn this comic, Beret Guy is surfing the Earth's tectonic plates. Tectonic plates move very slowly compared to a normal surfing experience — so slowly, ordinary people perceive them to be stationary ground. But Beret Guy, in typical Beret Guy fashion, sees the broader picture in the most whimsical way possible and is now surfing the plates across the Earth's mantle below. He seems to be moving horizontally at about 4-5 cm\/year (~1 m\/20 yrs) which would put him on one of the moderately fast plates, [1] [2] at least relative to the more stable North American plate. For comparison, the fastest-moving plate, the Pacific Plate, would move about two meters in 20 years relative to the African Plate (which is used as the standard which all other plate motions are measured against).\n\nWhile doing this he says\"Radical\",\"Gnarly\", and\"Hang loose\" which are exclamations commonly used among surfers. After 20 years, he is still standing there, having moved about one meter with the continental plate. This is thus another of the strange powers of Beret Guy — being able to stay in place for 20 years. This was also seen in 1088: Five Years, where he waited five years to find out where he would be after that time.\n\nThe title text refers to riding the barrel, in which one surfs inside the hollow part of a breaking wave, while a wipe out means you get swept off your surf board. If you wipe out in a barrel, you most likely submerge under water. If this were possible in tectonic surfing, you would be stuck under a tectonic plate and you would have to wait until the material you're trapped in erodes. In reality, there's no such thing as breaking waves in plate tectonics, but there are geological folds that can be seen as similar to the way that turbulent water mixes. Things do get trapped when two tectonic plates collide in a process called subduction, in which one plate disappears below another.\n\nOf note, Beret Guy is mentioned to have a\"subduction license\", as seen in 1388: Subduction License, so he may have some recourse in such a situation. Due to said license, he would survive and reemerge from the continental plate barrel in a million years time.\n\nA previous comic about tectonics being slow is 2061: Tectonics Game.","comic_index":2987},{"URL":"https:\/\/www.explainxkcd.com\/wiki\/index.php\/2988","Publish date":"September 20, 2024","Explanation":"Maslow's hierarchy of needs is a psychological model initially proposed by Abraham Maslow in 1943. It posits that all humans have certain requirements for a healthy and fulfilled life, and that these can be prioritized by how fundamental and foundational they are. The most basic needs are physical, such as food, water, and shelter, as humans can't survive without them in the long term. Then come things like safety, which includes physical safety, but also protection from things like emotional and economic threats. Beyond these come less urgent needs, such as love and social belonging, with the top (at least in simplified versions) being\"self-actualization\" or something similar.\n\nThe idea is frequently represented by a segmented triangle diagram, with basic foundational needs near the bottom creating the stability to enable self-actualization at the top, at least in the'simplified' version. This diagram has become so popular that it's commonly referred to as\"Maslow's Pyramid\", even though Maslow himself never actually used the term.\n\nIn this comic, Cueball has interpreted the concept of Maslow's Pyramid literally. He attempts to achieve true happiness by building an actual, physical pyramid that resembles the common representation of Maslow’s hierarchy. Cueball complains that the pyramid only fulfills one of the five needs listed on its side: physical safety, as it's\"highly defensible\". However it seems it completely fails to provide Cueball with Self-Actualization, Esteem, Belonging and Love. It can also potentially provide shelter, but that's only one of multiple physical needs.\n\nThe pyramid is useless for his social and emotional needs: everyone, like Megan and White Hat whom he shows his pyramid to and including Cueball himself, thinks the pyramid was a poor idea. Despite the impressive accomplishment of constructing such an edifice, Cueball apparently feels entirely unfulfilled, and is\"honestly questioning [his] life choices\".\n\nThe pyramid's size can be estimated thanks to Cueball standing close to it. A single tier appears to be roughly two Cueballs in height (meaning that with Cueball being 1.7m to 2.0m tall, the 5-tier pyramid would be 17-20m tall, equivalent to a building with about six or seven storeys) and the base appears roughly 16 Cueballs in length (meaning 27-32m wide, potentially covering an area of ~700-1200m²). Compared to famous Egyptian pyramids that is a rather modest monument but it would be comparable to the Louvre Pyramid in size.\n\nThe title text calls into question the notion that it provides even physical security. It apparently fails to comply with fire and building codes, which is potentially dangerous to both Cueball and his community. Moreover, he implies that inspectors can't even access the building, due to\"all the traps\". The notion of real-life pyramids (and other ancient structures) being filled with active booby-traps is commonly portrayed in fiction, and it seems that Cueball built such traps into his pyramid. Of course, in a modern structure, such traps would almost certainly be illegal on their own (particularly if they prevented authorities from accessing the property), and living in a pyramid full of traps would potentially be a danger to Cueball himself. Even if the structure provided physical safety, if it put him in legal jeopardy (and likely economic danger, considering how expensive it must have been to build), means that it doesn't even fulfill that need.","comic_index":2988},{"URL":"https:\/\/www.explainxkcd.com\/wiki\/index.php\/2989","Publish date":"September 23, 2024","Explanation":"This comic is about a thermostat in a physics lab which, instead of controlling the air temperature, adjusts the Boltzmann constant in the immediate area, a value relating temperature to energy equal to 1.38×10 −23 J\/K, where J is joules, a unit of energy, and K is kelvin, a unit of temperature. The dial shows different values for the constant, implying that it can be changed, which would be disturbing as a lot of what our current understanding of physics assumes it can't be. Thankfully, in reality there is no way to change the Boltzmann constant, so the comic is making fun of the idea of a scientist casually adjusting a fixed law of physics as if it were something simple like room temperature.\n\nIf the Boltzmann constant could be changed, it would affect how we experience temperature. The energy range on the dial relative to the actual Boltzmann constant might correspond to (or feel like?) apparent temperatures of 15°C (59°F) on the left, to 29°C (84°F) on the right, because raising the value of the constant would decrease the apparent temperature. There have previously been control panels for properties of the universe in 1620: Christmas Settings and 1763: Catcalling. A thermometer including units compatible with this thermostat (after dividing by 2\/3) is shown in 2292: Thermometer.\n\nThe title text builds on the absurdity of being able to adjust the Boltzmann constant. It suggests that if the constant could be changed, hopefully it would only affect the air in the room and not other substances. In particular, the metabolism of the room's occupants is hopefully unaffected. Imagining that this strange version of an HVAC ( heating, ventilation, and air conditioning) system could contain such a change to just the room's air shows the ridiculousness of trying to isolate the effects of altering a universal constant.","comic_index":2989},{"URL":"https:\/\/www.explainxkcd.com\/wiki\/index.php\/2990","Publish date":"September 25, 2024","Explanation":"A major part of understanding how life-forms existed and operated in the past involves finding fossilized remains, and working out a timeline of when they lived, based on the sediment layers in which they were found (among other factors). Modern paleontology has resulted in many of these fossilized remains being dug up and assembled into complete skeletons, which are frequently put on display in museums and other facilities.\n\nThis comic posits a future in which the remains of current civilization become buried in sediment, likely as a result of humanity going extinct so as to allow the premise of this comic to occur. Modern science estimates nearly all human-made activity - glass, concrete, steel - would erase to nothing within at most 1000 years (see Life After People and The World Without Us), meaning that any future life-forms, extraterrestrial or evolved modern-day species, would be hard pressed to find anything that suggested this planet used to be inhabited by humans, save for some microplastics, nuclear waste and - in this scenario - preserved dinosaur bones, apparently.\n\nWhile a question may arise as to why exactly no dinosaur fossils can be found in the intervening ~66 million years (which we know is because they went extinct and later ones were actually dug up by a different species), the real-life fossil record is quite sporadic, meaning such gaps should not be seen as unusual (these gaps are termed Lazarus taxons).\n\nThe title of the strip refers to the Cenozoic era, which is the current geological era. The term\"late Cenozoic\" implies some geological change would occur significant enough to warrant designating a new era; either these changes led to the end of human civilization or are in fact spurred by them.\n\nThe title text says that a high amount of resin and human DNA found in these fossils led to them theorizing dinosaurs ate humans. When reconstructing fossils, resin is often used to recreate missing or incomplete bones amongst other purposes in assembling and displaying a\"complete\" skeleton. Since this resin is made and mixed by humans, [ citation needed] incidental human DNA sources (such as cast off skin cells and hair) almost certainly get mixed in, leading to this misconception.\n\nA similar museum, misunderstood by humans instead of this other species, is depicted in 2760: Paleontology Museum.","comic_index":2990},{"URL":"https:\/\/www.explainxkcd.com\/wiki\/index.php\/2991","Publish date":"September 27, 2024","Explanation":"A beamsplitter is a device, usually made from a pair of prisms or a half-silvered mirror, that splits a beam of light into two beams going in different directions. Beamsplitters are used in numerous scientific instruments such as microscopes and (here) telescopes. In a microscope, for example, a beamsplitter may be used to direct the imaging beam to the user's eyes, or to a recording device such as a camera, or to both at once so as to allow visual aiming at specific targets at the same time as conducting scientific measurements upon them. Beam-splitting in order to simultaneously analyse a single'ray' of light with two or more different types of detectors is also scientifically useful.\n\nIn this comic, a beamsplitter is being used in a large-scale telescope to\"steal\" part of the incident light beam and direct it to a photovoltaic cell. The power generated is then sold on the local grid. The scientists could be pocketing the proceeds, or possibly using them to help pay the telescope operation's bills. This could be dark humor, implying that surreptitious and legally\/ethically questionable strategies are needed to fund scientists and their projects. The comic pushes the point by supposing that the practice had become so commonplace that the International Astronomical Union (IAU) got wind of it, and has acted to ban it.\n\nMost optical instruments, even large telescopes, are unlikely to capture enough light during regular operations to make the\"banned\" strategy feasible. (Far more light would reach the solar cell if it was simply left outdoors, even on a cloudy day.) Moreover, the ban is ham-fisted, as it makes legitimate scientific operation of telescopes profoundly more difficult. For the sake of the joke, both of these issues are ignored.\n\nThe telescope shown, without the beam splitter, is a reflecting telescope of the general form of a Gregorian telescope, or a derivative, while the sending of (a fraction of) the light out the side is implemented in the manner of a Nasmyth telescope.\n\nThe title text humorously conflates financial tax laws, applicable to the sale of the\"stolen\" electricity, with the laws of quantum physics, governing the behavior of the photons that are generating the electricity. Under typical capital gains tax laws, certain intangible assets such as stocks are not taxed until they are sold, at which point taxes will be levied on the profits of the sale (relative to the asset's purchase price). This is typically done to simplify tax assessment, as it can be very difficult to assign a concrete value (and thus tax burden) to certain assets until they are sold and the value realized.\n\nThe title text imagines a fictional\"quantum tax law\" in which individual photons are treated as taxable assets. Due to the probabilistic nature of the photon's wave function, the monetary value of any given photon entering the telescope is uncertain up until the point where it strikes the photovoltaic cell, generating an electron which is sold to the power grid. Under the quantum tax law, the\"wavefunction\" of the photon refers not to its traditional quantum wave function, but to the monetary wavefunction which can only be observed once the photon has generated a tangible profit. This is likely an analogy with capital gains tax which does not accrue until assets are sold at a profit over their purchase price.","comic_index":2991},{"URL":"https:\/\/www.explainxkcd.com\/wiki\/index.php\/2992","Publish date":"September 30, 2024","Explanation":"This comic uses dimensional analysis to describe the end of coal-powered energy production in the United Kingdom, in reference to the shutting down of the Ratcliffe-on-Soar coal power plant in central England on Monday, September 30, 2024. This event signified the closure of the last coal-fired power plant in the UK. This is an important milestone in global energy use, because the United Kingdom was at the forefront of the Industrial Revolution, which began an era of large-scale coal extraction to fuel the world's industries. Over the course of the past several decades, coal has increasingly fallen out of favor, with natural gas becoming a more viable power source, and an increasing percentage of energy needs being met without the use of fossil fuels (from sources such as nuclear, hydro, solar and wind power). The fact that the UK has now fully transitioned away from the use of coal as a major energy source marks a major shift in how industrialized nations are powered.\n\nUK coal production has also been in decline significantly since the politically enforced decline in the 1980s, and the proposed opening of the new Woodhouse Colliery in Cumbria seems to have been stopped, leaving just the remnants of the coal-mining industry active. There remain uses for coal, both locally obtained and imported, but the conversion away from coal in various industries marks a possible soft-end to the era of coal use in Britain. The equation shown in the comic determines how much coal was mined in the UK with respect to the surface area of the region, and calculates that this represents the removal of an average of about 8.0 cm (in imperial units, 3.2 inches) across the whole of the United Kingdom. This is another example of Randall doing unusual unit cancellation, as seen for instance in the What If? chapter Droppings. The accompanying picture implies that this coal has actually been removed in an even layer across the surface area of the country, resulting in ground level now being three inches lower. In reality, coal is extracted from deposits in specific locations, leaving other areas generally unaffected. Also while some of it has been open-cast mined, leaving visible quarrying scars (that may have been partially relandscaped), much of it has been mined sub-surface, with minimal effect on the surface itself, except where it may cause localized subsidence, sometimes of significant depth.\n\nThe calculation can be performed as follows:\n\n<ul><li>UK total coal production: 25 billion = 25,000,000,000; tonnes = metric tons = 1000kg. So 25 billion tonnes = 25,000,000,000,000kg<\/li>\n<li>coal seam density: 1L = 0.001m<sup>3<\/sup>.

The volume of earth described, 0.1 nm × 240,000 km 2, is equal to 24 m 3 (≈ 31 cubic yards). The text refers to Watership Down, a 1972 novel about a group of English rabbits. (A sole sequel to Watership Down, Tales from Watership Down, was published in 1996.) The text also refers to a former rabbit-run coal plant in the UK and claims that it was shut down in the 1990s. No actual rabbit-run coal plants have ever been documented.

Examples for this trope are Pushing Ice by Alastair Reynolds and Rogue Moon by Algis Budrys. The Arthur C.

The Elf who is telling him about Númenor, and Aragorn's link to it, becomes progressively more upset, and for cause.\n\nAragorn, more precisely Aragorn II, is the principal Mannish protagonist of Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings. He is crowned High King of Gondor and Arnor at the end of the saga. He is descended from Elros Tar-Minyatur, first king of Númenor and brother of Elrond.\n\n\"I'd rather die while I'm living than live while I'm dead\" is a line from Buffett's song\"Growing Older But Not Up\", from his 1981 album Coconut Telegraph. Ar-Pharazôn, the twenty-fifth, and last, king of Númenor, sought to conquer the Undying Lands, resolving to win eternal life, or die in the attempt.

This comic imagines that all possible (and some improbable) comma positions in an example sentence are associated with different universities. This applies to commas which should always be present in a list, optional commas (regardless of whether they have anything to do with a list, such as after the word\"please\") and blatantly erroneous commas (which should never be present in a sentence, e.g. immediately prior to the full stop \/period).\n\nThe Oxford comma (a.k.a. serial comma or, despite how this comic represents it, the actual Harvard comma) is a comma between the penultimate item in a list and its conjunction (typically and or or), to echo all the commas (at least one) that act as placeholders for the conjunction in-between all prior members of the list. For instance, you might write\"red, white, and blue\" (with the Oxford comma) or\"red, white and blue\" (without it). Some style guides, such as The Oxford Style Manual published by Oxford University Press, (unsurprisingly) recommend using it, while other similarly authoritative guides recommend against it. Though even those with either recommendation may suggest its (non-)use in situations where this avoids an ambiguity arising from the normally recommended choice.\n\nOne common example showing the need for an Oxford comma is\"To my parents, Ayn Rand, and God\". Without the comma (as in:\"To my parents, Ayn Rand and God\"), it may read that the author's parents are Ayn Rand and God. If such confusion is to be avoided, reordering the list is a common way to avoid ambiguity, for example,\"To Ayn Rand, God and my parents\" is one such reordering. However, the use of an Oxford comma in this version might imply the deification of Ayn Rand. Conversely, if the sentence was instead to be\"To my mother, Ayn Rand, and God\", with such a comma, there arises the possibility of an assertion that one's mother is Ayn Rand, whereas\"To my mother, Ayn Rand and God\" does not let one fall into that trap.\n\nMacaroni and cheese (often shortened to\"Mac and cheese\" in the US and Canada) should be considered a single item in a list like this. When just two items are joined together, e.g. to name a compound food such as\"peanut butter and jelly\",\"fish and chips\" or\"steak and eggs\", a comma isn't placed before\"and\". It is in the use of such compounded items, as a singular list item, where some confusion can arise. Alternate forms (\"fish'n'chips\",\"salt-and-pepper\",\"PB&J\") can put emphasis upon the low-level linking of the components, the outer list can be rewritten (e.g. with semicolon separation) or the reader can be left to logically assume where such a commonly encountered pairing is not part of the wider list. A difference in conjunction can also help to clarify, as in\"A good choice of breakfast is ham and eggs, sausage and eggs or sausage and beans, but not ham and beans\", which is unlikely to be accidentally misunderstood (including as options such as\"sausage + (eggs or additional sausage) + beans\" or\"sausage + ('non-ham' beans) + further beans\").\n\nIn the most common interpretation the example sentence reads (with proper punctuation and bracketed Oxford comma):\"Please buy apples, mac and cheese, milk[,] and bread.\"\n\nHowever, most of the commas are possible punctuation marks in a specific pragmatic reading of the sentence:\n\n<table class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:auto\">\n<tr>\n<th> Comma name <\/th>\n<th> Notation <\/th>\n<th> Explanation\n<\/th><\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td> Harvard comma <\/td>\n<td> Please<span style=\"color:red; font-weight:bold\">,<\/span> buy apples, mac and cheese, milk[,] and bread. <\/td>\n<td> Emphatic plea, marked by a sub-clause separator.

Such treaties, and other more casual associations between nations, can be based upon some close association in geographical, political, cultural and\/or economic terms (or even, in some cases, by little more than sharing a common opposition to a different bloc of nations).\n\nThe\"CIDABM\" group, named for the very specific membership criteria, has been formed on a rather more abstract basis than most geographically-focused groupings (e.g. NATO or the Pacific Islands Forum) and (currently) consists of four otherwise disparate islands:\n\n<ul><li><a class=\"extiw\" href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Sicily\" title=\"wikipedia:Sicily\">Sicily<\/a> is an autonomous region of <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Italy\" title=\"wikipedia:Italy\">Italy<\/a>, which is on the south eastern edge of the <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Eurasia\" title=\"wikipedia:Eurasia\">Eurasian<\/a> mainland.<\/li>\n<li><a class=\"extiw\" href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Sri_Lanka\" title=\"wikipedia:Sri Lanka\">Sri Lanka<\/a> is a nation in its own right, south of <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/India\" title=\"wikipedia:India\">India<\/a>, which is on the southern edge of the Eurasian mainland.<\/li>\n<li><a class=\"extiw\" href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Hainan\" title=\"wikipedia:Hainan\">Hainan<\/a> is a province of <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/China\" title=\"wikipedia:China\">China<\/a>, which is on the south eastern edge of the Eurasian mainland.<\/li>\n<li><a class=\"extiw\" href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Tasmania\" title=\"wikipedia:Tasmania\">Tasmania<\/a> is a state of the nation of <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Australia\" title=\"wikipedia:Australia\">Australia<\/a>, south of the eastern side of <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Australia_(continent)\" title=\"wikipedia:Australia (continent)\">continental Australia<\/a> mainland.<\/li><\/ul>\n\nThese four islands'dangle below' their mainlands only because of the convention of having north at the top of maps. If the mapmaking convention had instead been to have south at the top, the islands might have been described as floating above their continents. Conversely, Madagascar, Newfoundland or Adelaide Island might have been applicable members of similar'dangling' alliances where the basic premise might come from one or other different map orientations.\n\nThe big island of Tierra del Fuego ( Isla Grande de Tierra del Fuego), mentioned in the title text, is off the southern tip of the Chilean mainland (as well as a small bit of Argentina). Unlike the others in the comic, it doesn't prominently'dangle' south of a mainland: it has narrow channels separating its northern and northwestern sides from the mainland, and other parts of the Tierra del Fuego archipelago surround its southwestern side and make it appear well-connected to the mainland. In addition, it isn't a single political entity: the island is split between Chile to the west and Argentina to the east. The'heated debate' mentioned in the title text may be a play on Tierra del Fuego being Spanish for Land of Fire.\n\nWhile the banner on stage depicts each of the islands with approximately the same size, Tasmania (68,400 km²) and Sri Lanka (65,600 km²) are much larger than Hainan (35,200 km²) and Sicily (25,800 km²).

A result of the storm was that northern lights were visible across much of the northern United States, including Massachusetts where Randall lives. The northern lights normally occur much farther north, making this a rare and spectacular occurrence. The rare color background of this panel is an idealized depiction of the northern lights.\n\nThe solar protons referenced are hydrogen nuclei ejected from the sun after their electrons were stripped. Since most hydrogen atoms are just a single proton and electron pair, once the electron is removed, the resulting ion is just a proton. These protons, being positively charged, interact with Earth's magnetosphere, and the resulting excitation of atoms in the atmosphere causes them to emit light in the form of aurora. In the northern hemisphere the aurora is called aurora borealis (Latin for\"northern dawn\") and in the southern hemisphere it is called aurora australis (Latin for\"southern dawn\").\n\nHere, Beret Guy takes on the task of giving the protons a cordial welcome to Earth, where they will spend the foreseeable future. He has set up a sign to welcome them, presumably because he normally does not see the northern lights. His sign notes that they will love being part of the atmosphere, since if the light of the aurora is being emitted it means that the protons are interacting with other atoms in the atmosphere. The sign also invites them to try creating water. Water consists of one oxygen atom and two hydrogen atoms sharing an electron each with the oxygen. Since the solar protons are just hydrogen nuclei, they can form water by interacting with oxygen atoms or hydroxide ions (OH -). Scientists believe that solar wind frequently creates water by interaction of the hydrogen nuclei with oxygen. However, the mechanism proposed involves solar wind first creating hydroxide from compounds in asteroids and space dust, and then another proton joining to make water. As most of the oxygen in Earth's atmosphere consists of O 2 molecules (two bound oxygen atoms), it is not clear if solar protons could create water in the atmosphere at the same time as the northern lights, as opposed to via various other intermediate atmospheric\/geological\/biological interactions which might take up hydrogen (ionised or otherwise).\n\nBeret Guy is repeating two common misconceptions about aurora: that they are created directly by solar energetic particles, and that they are dominated by protons. Most auroras are caused by electrons, and these electrons are mostly already trapped over the long term in Earth's magnetosphere (although many of them originated in the solar wind at some point). The interaction of the solar wind's magnetic field with Earth's magnetosphere can create strong electric fields parallel to the magnetic field lines near the poles, and these electric fields energize the electrons and accelerate them into the atmosphere, where their interactions with oxygen and nitrogen molecules create the emission lines of the aurora. It's not apparent if the misconceptions are Beret Guy's or Randall's.\n\nThe title text references water formation by saying that Beret Guy can introduce the solar protons\/hydrogen nuclei to cool oxygen atoms. In reality hydrogen nuclei from the solar wind do not need an introduction, [ citation needed] but instead, due to their great speed, form bonds with oxygen when they impact oxygen or hydroxide.","comic_index":2997},{"URL":"https:\/\/www.explainxkcd.com\/wiki\/index.php\/2998","Publish date":"October 14, 2024","Explanation":"Ravioli are a kind of stuffed pasta comprising a filling enveloped in thin pasta dough, commonly square shaped, and serving as the object of this comic's table, which can be seen as a kind of confusion matrix.

It follows #45: Exterior Kansas, released about three and a half months earlier. In this addition to the Bad Map Projections series, Randall has blended two different countries — the United States of America and Australia — into one.\n\nAs with a number of Bad Map Projections, the primary joke is the naming of this as a\"map projection\". Its depiction is particularly similar to 2807: Bad Map Projection: ABS(Longitude), in which geography is overlaid upon other geography. It also follows the practice of 2256: Bad Map Projection: South America, in which a general continental shape is forced upon other areas, with the general geographical outline of the 48 contiguous US states being merged with the political boundaries of Australia (with exceptions, most obviously Australia's Bass Strait being retained in lieu of the US's central Florida). At a further level of merging, the US states are repacked as subdivisions within the various Australian ones; as with the likes of 2394: Contiguous 41 States, it also takes some liberties with the relative neighboring positioning of some of these, although not by totally removing any of the actual contiguous United States. Alaska and Hawaii aren't included, likely because the 48 contiguous US states better match the shape and size of Australia. Australia also has no territories that would make a good match in size or shape for Alaska and Hawaii.\n\nThe geographically relative climate of the states of the USA is broadly opposite of Australia's. Australia's north is closest to the equator but the USA's north is farthest from the equator. Thus, if Australia's climate were literally applied to the US, Florida would be relatively cold while Maine would be hot. Likewise, applying USA's climate to Australia would make northern Australia unusually cold and southern Australia relatively hot.\n\nThe map pokes fun at superficial and irrelevant similarities between features of the maps of the United States and Australia, such as the shape of the east coasts of New England and the Cape York Peninsula, and the distance to the southern tip of the island of Tasmania and the length of the Florida peninsula. The end result is to illustrate a fanciful place which does not actually exist and thus would have limited worth for navigating either Australia or the USA, although navigation between two listed locations\/areas drawn from the same original continent would at least be broadly possible (with the possibility of a few'surprises' en route). The blending features cities from both countries on the map, e.g., San Francisco and Los Angeles (USA) close to Perth (Australia).\n\nThe states and territories of Australia are depicted with black lines\/labels, while the states of the United States and such cities as are taken from either nation are marked with gray. The Australian states are labeled with their full names, but the American states are given only their postal abbreviations. (Mississippi is mislabeled as MI, in addition to Michigan's own correct usage, instead of the official MS.) Western Australia is usually abbreviated to WA, but the convention here leaves that unambiguously assigned to the US state of Washington. Idaho, for some reason, is not labeled at all, and neither is the Australian island state of Tasmania.\n\nThe title text makes a joke that this map does not preserve area or direction (typically, a map projection sacrifices one to preserve the other, or both to correctly depict a particular distance metric), but does preserve the city of Melbourne as a feature located on the map, near the actual location of Melbourne, Florida. Note that this is not the correct location of Melbourne, Australia, as it is far too much east in the bad map projection, but there is nothing to stop the shared Melbourne being entirely'correct' and every other feature being shifted as a'compromise'. The concept of a point being'preserved', rather than actual dimensionally-meaningful quantities, is meaningless and just adds to the badness of the projection. There are other city names shared between the US and Australia, but they're not located at any obviously similar geographic locations; e.g., the location of Brisbane in the comic is based on the instance in Queensland, not California (potentially named after the main example) or North Dakota.\n\nThis is the second comic in October 2024 in which Tasmania appears, the first being 2996: CIDABM. Both feature the major island groups in the Bass Strait, in this case perhaps intended as a sort of analogue to the Florida Keys, or else orphaned coastline features across the'missing' segment of the US peninsula.\n\nFrom west to east, the Australian states and territories contain the following U.S. states; the positions of Australian cities on the map are also listed:\n\nWestern Australia contains the following U.S. states:\n\n<ul><li>Arizona<\/li>\n<li>California\n<ul><li> <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Perth,_Australia\" title=\"wikipedia:Perth, Australia\">Perth<\/a> appears on the California coast, about halfway between <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Los_Angeles\" title=\"wikipedia:Los Angeles\">Los Angeles<\/a> and <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/San_Francisco\" title=\"wikipedia:San Francisco\">San Francisco<\/a>.<\/li><\/ul><\/li>\n<li> Colorado<\/li>\n<li> Idaho<\/li>\n<li> Montana<\/li>\n<li> Nevada<\/li>\n<li> New Mexico<\/li>\n<li> Oregon<\/li>\n<li> Utah<\/li>\n<li> Washington<\/li>\n<li> Wyoming<\/li><\/ul>\n\nNorthern Territory contains the following U.S. states:\n\n<ul><li> Illinois<\/li>\n<li> Iowa<\/li>\n<li> Kansas<\/li>\n<li> Michigan (<a class=\"extiw\" href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Upper_Peninsula\" title=\"wikipedia:Upper Peninsula\">Upper Peninsula<\/a>)<\/li>\n<li> Minnesota\n<ul><li> <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Darwin_(Australia)\" title=\"wikipedia:Darwin (Australia)\">Darwin<\/a> is positioned in northwestern Minnesota.<\/li><\/ul><\/li>\n<li> Missouri<\/li>\n<li> Nebraska<\/li>\n<li> North Dakota<\/li>\n<li> South Dakota<\/li>\n<li> Wisconsin<\/li><\/ul>\n\nSouth Australia contains the following U.S. states:\n\n<ul><li> Arkansas<\/li>\n<li> Louisiana\n<ul><li> <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Adelaide,_Australia\" title=\"wikipedia:Adelaide, Australia\">Adelaide<\/a> is located in the <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Mississippi_River_delta\" title=\"wikipedia:Mississippi River delta\">Mississippi River delta<\/a> region of Louisiana.<\/li><\/ul><\/li>\n<li> Oklahoma<\/li>\n<li> Texas<\/li><\/ul>\n\nQueensland contains the following U.S. states and territories:\n\n<ul><li> Connecticut<\/li>\n<li> Delaware<\/li>\n<li> District of Columbia<\/li>\n<li> Indiana<\/li>\n<li> Kentucky<\/li>\n<li> Maine<\/li>\n<li> Maryland<\/li>\n<li> Massachusetts<\/li>\n<li> Michigan (<a class=\"extiw\" href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Lower_Peninsula\" title=\"wikipedia:Lower Peninsula\">Lower Peninsula<\/a>)<\/li>\n<li> New Hampshire<\/li>\n<li> New Jersey<\/li>\n<li> New York<\/li>\n<li> North Carolina\n<ul><li> <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Brisbane\" title=\"wikipedia:Brisbane\">Brisbane<\/a> is located on the coast in southeast North Carolina.<\/li><\/ul><\/li>\n<li> Ohio<\/li>\n<li> Pennsylvania<\/li>\n<li> Rhode Island<\/li>\n<li> Tennessee<\/li>\n<li> Vermont<\/li>\n<li> Virginia<\/li>\n<li> West Virginia<\/li><\/ul>\n\nNew South Wales contains the following U.S. states:\n\n<ul><li> Alabama<\/li>\n<li> Georgia\n<ul><li> <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Canberra\" title=\"wikipedia:Canberra\">Canberra<\/a>, and presumably the rest of the <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Australian_Capital_Territory\" title=\"wikipedia:Australian Capital Territory\">Australian Capital Territory<\/a>, is located in southeastern Georgia.<\/li><\/ul><\/li>\n<li> Mississippi<\/li>\n<li> South Carolina\n<ul><li> <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Sydney,_Australia\" title=\"wikipedia:Sydney, Australia\">Sydney<\/a> is located along the coast of South Carolina, near the location of <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Charleston,_South_Carolina\" title=\"wikipedia:Charleston, South Carolina\">Charleston<\/a>.<\/li><\/ul><\/li><\/ul>\n\nVictoria and Tasmania combine to make up the U.S. state of Florida, which is now divided into two non-contiguous parts. As a result Tasmania, which has a history of being omitted from maps of Australia, is displayed but not named. Melbourne is located in the southeast corner of Victorian Florida.

There have been no confirmed sightings, but HV 2112 and HV 11417, both in the Small Magellanic Cloud, have in the past been considered strong candidates.\n\nCueball is asking for a grant for funding for research into these theoretical astral bodies, the implication being that they are asking funding for telescope time, or even an entirely new telescope, in order to make such investigations possible. However, the caption reveals that he is asking for something completely different: funding to create the object, with a gravitational slingshot. Normally, astrophysics is an observational discipline, but the title of the comic (made explicit by the caption text) suggests that this is intended to be a'practical' experiment to induce a TŻO into existence by actually sending a neutron star into our own Sun.\n\nCueball is complaining that no one is willing to fund this experiment to create the Thorne–Żytkow object for direct observation. Creating it would be impractical, for several reasons. First, you would need to find (or create!) a neutron star and bring it here, which requires amounts of energy, mass, and precision that we have no current possibility of achieving. Secondly, having a neutron star anywhere near the Sun would most likely destroy the solar system, or at least accelerate its transition to a red giant, which would likely result in Earth being engulfed by it and ruining the weather. The funding body, presumably based on Earth, would probably find the study would not pass an ethics review, and the end result would not generate a favorable environmental impact statement, given the almost inevitable destruction of our planet.\n\nA spin-off usually means something additional that was not originally planned. The title text in this comic is a two-layer joke on the phrase\"spin-off\", meaning that hitting the Sun off-center (from the right angle) would likely have many unintended consequences, but also cause the Sun to start rotating abnormally, due to the added angular momentum, in the same way as hitting a ball on the side makes it spin. A similar idea (the engulfment of a planet or companion star) has been proposed to explain the apparently anomalous rotation of the red supergiant Betelgeuse. [ actual citation needed]\"Spin-off\" could also refer to material being flung off the Sun due to the impact of the neutron star. If the right material is sent in certain directions, it could have useful, or more likely just'interesting', properties.","comic_index":3000},{"URL":"https:\/\/www.explainxkcd.com\/wiki\/index.php\/3001","Publish date":"October 21, 2024","Explanation":"<table class=\"notice_tpl\" style=\"background-color: white; border: 1px solid #aaa; box-shadow: 2px 2px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2); border-left: 10px solid #1E90FF; margin: 0 auto;\">\n<tr>\n<td> <img alt=\"Ambox notice.png\" height=\"40\" src=\"\/wiki\/images\/c\/c8\/Ambox_notice.png\" width=\"40\"\/>\n<\/td>\n<td style=\"padding:0 1em\"> <b>This explanation may be incomplete or incorrect:<\/b> <i>Created by a TOTALLY CONFORMING TEMPERATURE SYSTEM.

In modern times, most of the world uses the 1745 Celsius scale for everyday temperature measurements. A small number of countries (the USA and its territories, the Bahamas, Belize, the Cayman Islands, Liberia, and Palau) retain the imperial system (or the related US customary system), which uses the 1724 Fahrenheit scale. The other widely used temperature scale is the 1848 Kelvin scale, which uses the same degrees as Celsius, but is rooted at absolute zero, making it both useful in scientific calculations and easy to convert to and from Celsius (which, along with degrees Fahrenheit, is now defined relative to kelvins.) The Kelvin scale has been part of the widely adopted official metric system since 1954. Even in countries that use Fahrenheit, scientific measurements are usually made in degrees Celsius or kelvins.\n\nThe comic compares these scales, and a number of others, on Randall's scale of\"cursedness.\" The joke is highlighting how different the temperature scales are, and how impractical most of them are. All of the listed scales (except Randall's new °X scale defined in the title text) are real, but most are obsolete.

Disney World is one of a franchise of theme parks with attractions based on various Disney movies, while RNA world hypothesis is a proposed origin of life, in which RNA acts both as the genetic material and the enzymatic machinery needed to copy it.\n\nAriel is the titular character from The Little Mermaid. In the film she likes to collect human artifacts; the comic replaces this with collecting nucleotides, the basic building blocks of DNA and RNA.\n\nRatatouille is a film about a French rat named Remy who dreams of becoming a gourmet chef. The comic conflates the soup that a chef might create for patrons to eat with\" primordial soup\", the environment that's believed to have existed on the early Earth when the processes of life began.\n\nElsa is one of the lead characters from the Frozen movies. In the film she has the magical ability to control ice and snow, and she used this power to make the snowman Olaf come to life. The comic equates this with the original emergence of life on Earth, or life from non-life, through ribozyme synthesis. Ribozymes are RNA molecules that, similarly to enzymes made of protein, catalyze biochemical reactions, such as the splicing of RNA during gene expression.\n\nThe title text continues this by saying that since Elsa's ability is based on ribozymes, Olaf's machinery of life must be based only on RNA, not DNA. This fits in with the theme of RNA World. Olaf generally appears to be (by mass) mostly just snow but, in common with various ideas about the makeup of cometary ice (and the role played by them in'seeding' the young Earth with organic molecules), might well be thoroughly imbued with carbon-rich compounds other than those inherent in his carrot nose, coal buttons, and basic twig\/stick elements.\"Canonically\" refers to fictional canon (in this case Disney fiction),\"the body of works taking place in a particular fictional world that are widely considered to be official or authoritative.\"","comic_index":3002},{"URL":"https:\/\/www.explainxkcd.com\/wiki\/index.php\/3003","Publish date":"October 25, 2024","Explanation":"<table class=\"notice_tpl\" style=\"background-color: white; border: 1px solid #aaa; box-shadow: 2px 2px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2); border-left: 10px solid #1E90FF; margin: 0 auto;\">\n<tr>\n<td> <img alt=\"Ambox notice.png\" height=\"40\" src=\"\/wiki\/images\/c\/c8\/Ambox_notice.png\" width=\"40\"\/>\n<\/td>\n<td style=\"padding:0 1em\"> <b>This explanation may be incomplete or incorrect:<\/b> <i>Created by a BOTWICH HELIX - Please change this comment when editing this page.

However, when pressed on what that is, he says nobody knows — indicating that, over the years, communication has failed to retain the meaning of this supposedly very important concept. The humor is that if this truly was the #1 rule of communication, communication should have been able to retain its meaning. On the basis that the number #1 rule about communication would probably be the most important rule, it might even be construed to be the rule about properly communicating all context (by some apparent analogy), which would be irony — but only if anyone still understood it.\n\nThe comic also displays the difference between meaning and message. Cueball is parroting a message (possibly a cliche repeated by self-help authors and influencers), even though the meaning is lost.\n\nThe fictitious\"Sandwich Helix\" plays on another concept in communication, the\" Compliment Sandwich\" (a.k.a.\"Shit Sandwich\"), wherein a statement of criticism is sandwiched between two complimentary statements in order to make the negative statement easier to accept. The difference is that the Compliment Sandwich is a communication technique which is well known and whose meaning has not been lost (though it is currently disputed whether the technique is effective or whether it even might accomplish the inverse of its goals). A possible inspiration for the\"helix\" part is the Helical Model of Communication. The creator of the model, Frank Dance, emphasised the role of communication problems. He shows communication as a dynamic and non-linear process.\n\nThe title text contains several odd-looking characters that seem random (but are actually meaningful, to those familiar with them) where an apostrophe should be, as an example of a string that did NOT have its encoding handled properly. It is an example of Mojibake. Some special characters and symbols require a special encoding (such as UTF-8, Windows-1252, Shift-JIS, etc) in order to be stored and displayed properly, and are encoded using the equivalent of multiple characters. If the code to display the text doesn't understand what encoding was used and assumes a different\/lesser level of encoding, you can get\"garbage\" similar to what is in the title text. In this case, the original character was probably ’, which when encoded in UTF-8 and decoded in Windows-1252 becomes â€™. Similar garbage is seen in the title text of 1683: Digital Data.","comic_index":3003},{"URL":"https:\/\/www.explainxkcd.com\/wiki\/index.php\/3004","Publish date":"October 28, 2024","Explanation":"<table class=\"notice_tpl\" style=\"background-color: white; border: 1px solid #aaa; box-shadow: 2px 2px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2); border-left: 10px solid #1E90FF; margin: 0 auto;\">\n<tr>\n<td> <img alt=\"Ambox notice.png\" height=\"40\" src=\"\/wiki\/images\/c\/c8\/Ambox_notice.png\" width=\"40\"\/>\n<\/td>\n<td style=\"padding:0 1em\"> <b>This explanation may be incomplete or incorrect:<\/b> <i>Created by a MAGICALLY WATERLOGGED OIL DRILL - Please change this comment when editing this page.

Freshwater surface sources like rivers and lakes most obviously dictate where people live, but are subject to changes of quantity and quality (e.g. the seasons\/weather and what other people are doing with(\/in) the water, upstream). Water can also be present beneath the surface in aquifers, gradually having soaked through into various soil and\/or rock layers, and may emerge (far more reliably and usably) from handy seeps and springs where the local ground topology is favorable. But geology and geography don't coincide so usefully everywhere that someone requires water.\n\nMany modern countries (and a number of historic ones) will have at least some ability to pipe water from areas of high availability (e.g. from areas with reservoirs, natural or constructed) to other places of higher consumption (towns and cities), but not everyone will have piped water and may find it better to rely upon a well, a hole dug into the ground, deep enough to reach the local water to lift or pump out as needed. A borehole is similar, but may even puncture impermeable bedrock to access water held (under significant pressure) in rock layers below.\n\nThis comic pokes fun of the seemingly improbable characteristics of wells and boreholes; talking about how water\"randomly\" forms below the surface of the ground and how they\"magically\" refill themselves. It also pokes fun at how unrealistic it seems for people to have come up with the concept of wells in the first place; people would have had to dig a hole and hope that water appears.\n\nIn reality the complex systems of the water cycle dictate the formation of the underground'pools' that the wells take from and the seeps of underground water that supply them, meaning that it's not really so surprising (nor necessarily quite as simple as it sounds) to get your water from beneath the ground, and is a process not restricted to humans. This theme of things that seem like they shouldn't work, but do, has also been used in 2540: TTSLTSWBD, 2115: Plutonium, and 2775: Siphon, among others.\n\nThe title text points out that in some cases, people intending to drill water wells instead found oil beds. Oil is a very valuable energy source, so they became very wealthy as a result. This is the source of the idiom\"struck oil\" to mean receiving a windfall as a result of a lucky occurrence. But you have to be careful — if you blindly\"drink whatever you find at the bottom\", as Megan says, you'll get very sick if it's oil rather than water.

Whereas the traditional approach was for such rocketry to allow most of the initial launch-vehicle to be a single-use stage that was effectively destroyed once it had fulfiled its purpose, it has become a developmental aim across much of the commercial side of the industry to introduce as much reusability as possible in the mission hardware to potentially save costs and construction time.\n\nIn order to accomplish a successful recovery, expended stages have been given unprecedented ability to control their fall back to the ground, often in a manner that allows them to propulsively halt their descent directly over a prepared landing pad (on land or sea) and settle down softly enough on landing gear to be refurbished and reused (sometimes for more than twenty subsequent missions). For the recent Starship test, the one (and, as of this comic, only) attempt to recover its Super Heavy Booster involved being precisely guided to be caught by the original launch tower; though it is never expected to refly, as a test prototype, it survived the whole process. This is in contrast with plenty of examples, where the landings (or their aftermath) were not quite so successful.\n\nThough SpaceX is the current leader in such an accomplishments, there are other companies who are various degrees along a similar developmental route. Randall claims that he has an organisation that is amongst them, and has achieved the non-trivial feat of being able to direct the discarded rocket stage very precisely, yet without that extra bit of ability to ensure that it doesn’t then subsequently explode. The team has therefore decided to exploit their achievement (to precisely control the rocket) to send it'safely' into a hole that (barely larger than the rocket's cross-section, and with a sturdy lid directly manhandled by a Cueball employee) allows it to rapidly disassemble in a planned and'safe' manner. Of course, as a'compromise', it does not achieve the original aims of recoverability and reusability, yet it also is intrinsically far more complicated than the default option of just letting the hardware generally fall to destruction somewhere in a handy'empty' down-range area that shouldn't inconvenience anybody.\n\nWith the comic depicting the'disposed' stage as powering downwards, this might explain their lack of success in perfecting any form of intact recovery, as practical examples of this technology tend to spin the craft around to make use of the main thruster(s) for a retrorocket -assisted landing, or at least don't try to counteract the passive deceleration provided by parachutes or other purposeful aerodynamic drag, in order to touch the ground at a survivable velocity.\n\nAn explosion in a sealed container is potentially much more dangerous than an explosion in the open, depending on the strength of the container. If the container is strong enough to hold the pressure from the explosion, that pressure could be released in a controlled fashion, safely. But if the container is too weak, it could suffer a catastrophic failure, sending shards of its walls and anything around it flying outwards at high speed. Even if the container is initially strong enough, it could be weakened by repeated explosions, and fail at a random time in the future. As the'container' is mostly a hole dug into the ground, of indeterminate depth, it might be considered fairly robust in itself, especially if given a reinforced lining. However, this then risks forcing the majority of the resulting explosion up into the lid, which looks strong and heavy yet is closed at least partly by the effort of just one person. It also risks that worker being right next to the track of the descending rocket stage, where they would be at risk of experiencing all kinds of secondary damage, if not being directly in the explosion if they get the timing of the lid-closure wrong. An actual attempt to put a lid on an underground explosion succeeded only in blowing the lid off at such velocity that it was never found.\n\nThe title seems to refer to the sound effects of dragging an element into the trash on computers. Or, alternatively, the sound of a canister being sucked into a vacuum tube.","comic_index":3005},{"URL":"https:\/\/www.explainxkcd.com\/wiki\/index.php\/3006","Publish date":"November 1, 2024","Explanation":"<table class=\"notice_tpl\" style=\"background-color: white; border: 1px solid #aaa; box-shadow: 2px 2px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2); border-left: 10px solid #1E90FF; margin: 0 auto;\">\n<tr>\n<td> <img alt=\"Ambox notice.png\" height=\"40\" src=\"\/wiki\/images\/c\/c8\/Ambox_notice.png\" width=\"40\"\/>\n<\/td>\n<td style=\"padding:0 1em\"> <b>This explanation may be incomplete or incorrect:<\/b> <i>Created by a DEMI-DEMONIC DOORMAN - Please change this comment when editing this page.

While a few physics-savvy humans might feel offended by such treatment [ citation needed], for most, the suffering would stem from the anxiety of knowing that, once they cross the door, they are not allowed to return for all eternity. So, unlike particles which move by simple virtue of having energy, they must choose when to cross it. This modern psychological approach to torture stands out from ancient techniques of physical torture such as being boiled in oil or cast into a flame pit.\n\nThe title text continues the joke by suggesting that while Maxwell's demon's idea for torturing the souls of the damned might seem whimsical to the other demons, it could still be used to heat the flame pits better. The other demons' appreciation of this technical improvement mirrors real-life situations where kids that\"have trouble fitting in with the others\" due to their unusual ideas for games and atypical interests (e.g. in thermodynamics) occasionally earn some appreciation when their cleverness is deemed useful.\n\nThis comic was published on 1 November, 2024, the day after Halloween, around the time when many contemporary comic strips have demonic, supernatural or other spooky themes.","comic_index":3006}]
