The mouseover text, \"Oh yeah? Give me 50 milliscore reasons why I should stop,\" extends the joke. A \"score\" is 20, and \"milli\" denotes one-thousandth. Therefore, a milliscore is 20 \/ 1000 = 0.02. Fifty milliscore is 50 * 0.02 = 1.

The parent is telling the children that they are going to watch Elsa (from Frozen) initiate runaway ribozyme synthesis.  The title and mouseover text refer to RNA, the RNA world hypothesis, and Olaf being made of RNA.  The parent mentions Ariel (The Little Mermaid) collecting nucleotides and Remy (Ratatouille) making primordial soup.  These are all Disney characters.  Nucleotides, primordial soup, ribozymes, and RNA are all related to the origin of life. The joke seems to be about combining Disney characters with concepts from the RNA world hypothesis.","explanation":"The comic reimagines a Disney theme park as \"RNAWorld,\" where attractions are based on the scientific concept of the RNA world hypothesis, a theory about the early development of life on Earth.  The humor comes from the juxtaposition of familiar Disney characters performing actions related to this complex scientific idea.  Ariel, known for her underwater adventures, is now collecting nucleotides, the building blocks of RNA. Remy, a chef, is preparing \"primordial soup,\" the hypothetical environment where life arose.
